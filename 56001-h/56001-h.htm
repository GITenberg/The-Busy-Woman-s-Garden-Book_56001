<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>This little book has a very definite aim&mdash;a big
aim too, though two little words or even one will
serve to define it&mdash;To help, or better still, perhaps&mdash;helpfulness.
It does not aim to tell everything
there is to tell about gardening; that would
be encyclopedic and quite out of the scope of a
small, practical work on gardening, but it does
aim to give, in plain, everyday language sufficient
and clear directions for caring for an ordinary
kitchen garden in a way the least exhausting of
time and strength and with all unnecessary expenditure
eliminated. It covers all necessary
detail except that of personal equation; that&mdash;Dear
Woman, when the spring time calls and
you go forth full of enthusiasm, is, in the language
of the day&mdash;"Up to you." Your garden will
give back to you just What you put into it&mdash;no
more, and the more you give to it the less it will
exact of you; neglect it ever so little and it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
prove a hard taskmaster indeed, or a living reproach&mdash;a
reproach that will burgeon and bloom
in noxious weeds and sickening plants, a garden
where the worm dieth not and the aphis and grub
revel undisturbed and unchecked.</p>

<p>There is nothing so easy as to keep a garden
in perfect order, free from weeds and pernicious
insect life, nothing easier than to have the reverse
of this. One cannot garden successfully on
the principle that one can work in the garden
when there is nothing else to do, no one to play
with, nowhere to go. The garden should be first
to a certain extent, and this is not an arbitrary or
exacting condition for the toll exacted is paid for
many times over in the peace of mind that comes
from work well and conscientiously done, to say
nothing of the economic value of thrifty vegetables.</p>

<p>There are always critical times in the life of
the garden;&mdash;the gardener must recognize these
and be prepared to give just the assistance the
condition requires at just the time it is required;
if this is done promptly it will surprise one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
has had no system heretofore in the garden
work to see how little time is really required to
care for a garden successfully. The failure to
co-operate with nature at the right time may
result in many hours of wearisome work.</p>

<p>Take the matter of weeds;&mdash;if the planting is
closely watched and the weeds cut off as quickly
as they show a seed leaf above ground, and before
they have stuck their roots deeply enough into
the ground to make more than a mere stirring of
the soil necessary, an entire week's crop of weeds
will be destroyed with one stirring of the soil.
Weeds come in relays a week or ten days apart,
come not at all if the soil is kept properly stirred&mdash;which
should be after every rain and between
if the rain is infrequent, and it is well worth one's
time to exercise a little self-denial and give this
cultivation even though it may mean letting
something else go that one would like to do.</p>

<p>And one need not worry too much about being
scientific in one's gardening; insecticides, fungicides
and the like are the allies of the careless
gardener, but the wide awake, industrious gardener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
has little need of them. Healthy, vigorous
plants are not especially susceptible to insect attacks
and with the exception of potato bugs, squash
bugs and cabbage worms the danger from them
is merely negligible, but the careless, slovenly
gardener is a real and pestilential danger.</p>

<p>There is much in choosing the right time of
day for work in the garden; it is delightful to
wield the rake and hoe in the cool of the afternoon,
but where the object is the destruction
of weeds the morning hours of a sunny
day will give permanent results as the weeds will
be killed by the hot sun, while those hoed up in
late afternoon will often be revived by the coolness
and dew of night and be ready to withstand
the morrow's sun, so take the morning hours for
destroying weeds, and the cooler hours for planting
seeds, staking up plants, thinning out plants
and the like but always the bright, dry sunny hours
for tying up such vegetables as need blanching:
cauliflower, endive and the like. This will make
for success in the various operations and comfort
in working.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix&ndash;x</a></span></p>

<p>Where it is necessary to water the garden this
should if possible be done after the sun has nearly
or quite gone from it in order to reduce the loss
of moisture by evaporation; this is especially desirable
in city gardens where the water is metered
and always, if possible a night's watering should
be followed by shallow cultivation the following
forenoon to restore the dust-mulch and necessitate
as little watering as possible. These are a
few of the little attentions which make for success
in the garden and minimize the sum of the season's
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="small">PLANNING THE GARDEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> favorable location of the garden is the
initial step in its planning. The kitchen
garden&mdash;always an important auxiliary of the
kitchen&mdash;is now, in these days, something more;
it is becoming more and more a part of the domestic
routine; it is a woman's garden, to be
planned for and cared for by the women of the
family, and in that relation must be considered
from all its points of view. Location, then, becomes
of first importance. It must be accessible,
that its care may demand as little extra work as
possible, and that little be given to the actual
cultivation and care and not to going back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
forth. If one can run out and cultivate a row of
lettuce or train up a row of peas while waiting for
the irons to heat or the kettle to boil, then one
will find the sum total of the garden work far less
onerous than where one must calculate on going
over the entire plat, or a stated portion of it, at
one operation.</p>

<p>A location close to the house, more or less
secluded, that one may work free from interruption
and espionage and where the vegetables may
bask in the sun from early morning till late afternoon,
is desirable, and this is best achieved in a
southern exposure with the garden rows running
north and south.</p>

<p>If the garden plot is protected by buildings or
a high fence, or a wind-break of evergreen on the
north it will afford a favorable position for the
necessary hotbeds and cold frames and the close
relationship of the two will work for efficiency in
handling.</p>

<p>A warm, mellow, sandy loam is the ideal soil
for the vegetable garden, but even a poor soil may
be so built up and redeemed by proper cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
and fertilising as to make the quality of the soil
of secondary consideration, but if one can have
both at once then one is happy indeed. Tenacious,
clayey soil or newly broken sod ground
should not, however, be undertaken by a woman,
such ground is a man's job.</p>

<p>But it is the warm, sunny location that is vital
to the successful cultivation of the garden. All
the early vegetables&mdash;peas, lettuce, endive and the
like&mdash;call for abundant sunshine in the cool days
of early spring, and, as the season advances and
the fall chill is in the air at nightfall, then the
warm sunshine will hasten the maturity of such
late comers as tomatoes, winter squash, citron and
any late-sown vegetables that are used to succeed
the earlier growths. Again in the late days of
winter or early spring those vegetables that were
left in the ground for early use&mdash;the parsnips,
and salsify, will be available much earlier if given
a warm location where the ground thaws readily,
rather than a cold exposure that holds frost late
in the season.</p>

<p>A piece of ground adjoining other cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
areas is far preferable to an isolated plot as it may
be ploughed in conjunction with the larger piece
and so kept in a better grade and condition. An
isolated garden plot, which must be prepared
separately necessitating a dead furrow in the
center, becomes, in the course of a few years a
dish shaped area very disagreeable to cultivate;
an open area, on two sides at least, obviates this in
a measure and renders the ground more level and
easily prepared.</p>

<p>Any garden spot, however, should always be
ploughed rather than spaded and as deep ploughing
as possible should be the rule. If the soil is
good go as close to the bottom of it as possible,
the shallow ploughing so universal&mdash;seldom more
than six inches in depth, does not give a mellow
bed for any but shallow rooted vegetables. Carrots,
salsify, parsnips and similar long-rooted
things must fairly drill their way into the hard
ground below the shallow cultivation, this resulting
in deformed, stunted or many twigged roots,
unsalable and of little value for the home table.
The long, smooth, beautiful bottoms are only produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
by deep cultivation to start with and, of
course, the subsequent cultivation must efficiently
supplement this. A very excellent method of
preparing the ground would be to turn a deep
furrow with the plough and follow this with the
subsoil plough, stirring up the subsoil, but not
mixing it with the top soil; this would give several
inches of loose soil beneath the first furrows
that the roots could readily penetrate. So many
consider that all the fertility in a soil is contained
in the few top inches of soil, and in a measure
this is true&mdash;the available fertility is right there&mdash;but
there is a wealth of unused fertility in the
lower strata, but lack of cultivation, lack of
moisture and most of all, lack of the humus which
makes the soil retentive of moisture, render it
unavailable, but if it is broken up and gradually
mixed with the humus of the upper soil it becomes
available and the soil is increasing in fertility instead
of growing thinner and poorer year by
year.</p>

<p>Following the ploughing comes the smoothing
and leveling of the ground by dragging with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
spiked or spring tooth harrow; this part of the
work should be very thoroughly done; too fine a
seed bed can never be produced, whatever the
means employed and the use of drags and harrows
by no means spells the whole operation of
fitting a garden for planting. After the dragging
the garden rake is in order and the ground
must be raked over and over until thoroughly
fine and free from roughage of sticks, stones,
clods and the like. If any weeds have been
drawn to the surface in dragging they must be
pulled out and thrown aside. If there is a dead
furrow in the middle of the plot then the raking
should be towards that from both directions so
as to fill it in as much as possible and so restore
the level of the ground.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to rake the entire garden at
once if time and strength are at a premium. One
may rake a space sufficient for the first planting
and when that is done rake another space and so
equalize the labor, but it is easier to rake soon
after the preliminary fitting is done than to leave
it until a rain has packed the earth and made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
heavy to move. A good rain, however, should
always precede the planting, if possible, as newly
worked ground is not sufficiently settled for sowing
seed and not so desirable for setting out of
plants.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the vegetables in the garden
has much to do with the convenience of caring
for it. It is always a good arrangement to
plant the early vegetables, such as lettuce, radishes,
beets, endive and onions at the end of the
garden nearest the house where they are most
easily available as one has occasion to use them in
preparing a meal. Then, too, all these small
things are planted a standard distance apart&mdash;usually
twelve or fifteen inches,&mdash;twelve if the
gardener is addicted to trowsers, fifteen if skirts
are in evidence, for it is difficult to work in a
narrower space, especially among the tender tops
of seedling onions, in petticoats. So, with the
rows running north and south, that the vegetables
may receive the greatest possible amount of sunshine,
and the vegetables planted in consecutive
rows of increasing distances apart, one has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
planting schedule economical of space and labor.</p>

<p>This order of planting should also be made to
include height as well as distance apart of the
rows of vegetables. Low growing things should
always occupy the front rows of space and not
be overshaded by tall growths. For this reason
the planting of sweet corn in the garden plot is
not desirable; it is best to give this a space by
itself&mdash;preferably on the north side of the garden.
Vine vegetables, too, have little place in the garden
proper&mdash;a place for them on the south side
of the garden should be reserved if possible,
for with the best of management they will break
bounds and encroach on other plants. I recall
a planting of English marrows which were
placed in the garden next to a row of red peppers.
They were bought for bush marrows but
proved to be the vine variety and in a month's
time had practically taken possession of that end
of the garden; peppers and tomatoes were smothered
under a luxuriant growth of squash vines
whose luxuriance was only equalled by the astonishing
amount of fruit they bore. In desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
effort to check their encroachments great lengths
of vines, bearing half grown marrows, were ruthlessly
removed with no more apparent result than
to encourage a still more luxuriant growth and
to increase the gardener's knowledge of the
amount of pruning a really ambitions, vigorous
vine will stand.</p>

<p>The bush varieties of many vegetables are a
great boon to the small home gardener as most
of them are prolific bearers and require no more
room than a hill of potatoes or an eggplant.
Squash, melons, lima beans&mdash;all have dwarf forms
that are preferable to the usual vine varieties.</p>

<p>The home garden should not be too large&mdash;a
plot forty by eighty feet will grow all the summer
and winter vegetables a small family can make
use of and a considerable surplus for sale,
especially is this the case where the corn and
vines are planted outside the garden proper.
Potatoes, too, are excluded from this estimate,
though a few rows of early potatoes may find
room available.</p>

<p>The accompanying planting table, while intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
to be merely suggestive will be of use
as indicating the amount of room required for
the several varieties of plants and a convenient
arrangement. The amount to be grown of any
one variety however, must be decided by the individual
gardener and it will be time well spent
to make a diagram for one's self, based on the
amount of various vegetables that experience
shows to be needed. To those vegetables to
which the family are most addicted should always
be added a few that are grown with the occasional
guest in mind and the few things that one likes to
try from season to season, and that add zest to
gardening but should never be allowed to occupy
space needed for more standard sorts.</p>

<h2> CHAPTER II <br />
<span class="small">HOTBEDS, COLD FRAMES AND FLATS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">So</span> important is the preparatory work performed
by a well started and conducted hotbed
that its use cannot be too insistently recommended.
The smallest, least ambitious home
garden is dependent upon the use of artificial
heat in the starting of such plants as cabbage,
cauliflower, peppers, tomatoes and the like,
either in hotbeds on the home grounds, flats in
the windows or plants grown in commercial greenhouses;
these, owing to the long season required
to bring them into bearing, cannot be started in
the open ground; especially is this true of such
heat loving things as peppers and tomatoes.</p>

<p>Owing to the quite general practice of buying
these plants of the commercial gardeners or
florists a much smaller area of ground is devoted
to their growth than would be the case were
the plants grown in one's own hotbeds where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
initial cost would have been that of a few packets
of seeds. Purchased plants are by no means
immune from late frosts or the assaults of cut
worms and not infrequently demand successive
replantings before a satisfactory stand is secured.
With a well stocked hotbed this does not spell
so great a disaster, as only the labor of resetting
is demanded and this is not of much moment as
the lines and points of setting are already laid
down and the hills of tomatoes, eggplants and
peppers already supplied with their spade full
of manure. In a generous sized garden where
perhaps a hundred plants of a kind are grown
the saving in the cost of plants will cover the
construction and maintenance of an ordinary
hotbed and the cost of a bed of the best concrete
construction, which will last almost a lifetime,
will be covered in a reasonably short time.</p>

<p>There is nothing about the construction or care
of a hotbed that offers any obstacles to its possession
and I have about come to the conclusion that
the only reason more gardeners do not have them
is because they cannot borrow them; they are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
only thing about a garden that some one can't
and doesn't borrow and if some one would invent
a portable one it would undoubtedly become
popular.</p>

<p>The requirements are simple:&mdash;A sunny
location, protected from prevailing winds&mdash;usually
from the west, and on the north by a wall,
building or fence. Being started in the early
days of spring&mdash;from February, in the vicinity
of the Ohio river, to late March or early April in
the vicinity of the Great Lakes; they require a
background that will hold the heat of the sun
instead of allowing it to escape.</p>

<p>A well-drained position should be chosen and
it should be as handy to the house and garden as
practicable, especially the former as, once it is
planted and plants up and growing, it will require
frequent supervision in the changeable weather
of early spring. Under a bright sun the temperature
rises very rapidly in a glass-covered
hotbed and it is necessary to see that it does not
rise high enough to injure the plants; equally
the temperature falls rapidly in an open bed when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the sun goes under a cloud, and the sash must be
adjusted to meet these deviations of temperature;
often a moment's work in raising or lowering
the sash will spell success or failure in the
conduct of the bed.</p>

<p>A pit or excavation in the ground for holding
a supply of fermenting manure to furnish heat
for the bed is the first step in the construction
of the hotbed; the size and depth of this will
depend somewhat upon the number of plants it
is desired to produce and upon the rigors of the
climate and the prevalence of late springs and
frosts. As a general thing, for the ordinary
home garden a bed three feet by twelve is sufficient,
but the added expense of a few additional
feet is so slight and the use of a bed so appeals
to one once one realizes its convenience, that it
is seldom a mistake to make it too large as,
aside from the sowing of seed, it may be used
for starting roots of bedding plants, cannas,
dahlias, begonias, tuberoses, caladiums; the striking
of cuttings and many garden operations that
have formerly been done in a bungling, cumbersome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
way in the house or with the costly assistance
of the florists.</p>

<p>The depth of the pit should not be less than
three feet and four, from the top of the frame,
is better, as it is upon the depth of the manure
that the length or duration of the heat depends.
A shallow pit will give a quick heat which soon
gives out, usually when most needed, during a
sudden cold wave, and as the expense of a foot
more or less counts for little it is best to be on
the safe side and have sufficient heat.</p>

<p>If economy must be observed or the bed is
for temporary use, a rough frame of boards will
answer every purpose; it need not even extend
below the surface of the ground, but merely rest
upon it, but such construction is not to be recommended
except for temporary structures or where
it is desired to remove the frame as soon at it
has served its purpose in supplying plants for
spring planting; but a well built, permanent hotbed
has by no means served its mission with the
passing of the spring months, it may be profitably
kept in commission the year around.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>If, however, the construction must be along
economical lines waste lumber and old window
sash may be employed very satisfactorily. Having
dug the pit of the required depth and width
and length&mdash;three feet if old sash are to be used
will be the best width and is desirable
anyway as it can be easily reached across and
can be placed close to a building and so occupy
much less ground than where the usual florist
sash is used, a frame consisting of four upright
posts two by four inches and six feet long for the
two rear posts and five feet long for the front,
to give the necessary slant to the frame, should
be used; on these the boards for the sides and ends
should be nailed, the end boards sawed to a true
slant that the sash may rest evenly upon them; the
frame is then lowered into the pit and the soil
leveled off around it and made firm so that no
cold air finds entrance. To such a frame the sash
may be hinged at the back and notched sticks
adjusted to hold it at any desired angle.</p>

<p>In the permanent cement hotbed the pit is
dug as before, then interlined with boards to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
a mould and the space filled in with a good cement
mixture, paddling it smooth on the side
next to the boards and allowing the boards to
remain in place until the cement has hardened.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>1</sup></a>
Before the cement has set, however, a
frame of two by four must be fitted on top of
the cement to receive the sash. Long spikes
should be driven through the timbers at intervals
to be pressed into the cement to insure a good
joint. It is also an advantage to arrange for
partitions through the bed by nailing cleats of
wood on the inside of the wooden form at points
where the sash will meet. This will form slots in
the concrete into which thin boards can be slipped
to separate such plants as require much heat from
those requiring less heat and much air. The partitions
should not extend much, if any below the
surface of the soil so the slots need not extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
below the top foot of wall. These partitions
are not really necessary but often come in very
handy and are so easily arranged for that their
occasional use justifies their presence. Where
they are employed the sash can be left open where
required far more safely than if they were not
in use. Cabbage and cauliflowers do best if given
plenty of air and even a tinge of frost will not
injure them, while it would be fatal to such heat
loving plants as tomatoes, peppers, eggplants
and many tender flowers and bulbous plants.</p>

<p>The double sash is a great protection for hotbeds
started very early, but as a rule there is
little occasion for starting the beds before the
middle of March or early April in the northern
states as it is only necessary to give the plants
about six weeks' start of open ground operations.
Usually we make our out-of-door planting about
the twentieth of May at the north and correspondingly
later as we go south, but if we count back six
weeks from "Corn planting time," the country over
we will have reliable data for starting the hotbed.
Plants left too long in the bed deteriorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
and should be scheduled to be got into the
ground as soon as they are fit; if this is done they
will not suffer from over crowding nor will it be
necessary to transplant; though this is always an
advantage with certain plants. If to the hotbed
is added the convenience of a cold frame to which
the cabbage and cauliflower can be transplanted
as soon as they show rough leaves it will be a decided
advantage and the room thus secured in the
hotbed can be used to transplant tomatoes, peppers
and the like, thus giving better rooted, stockier
plants.</p>

<p>Fresh horse manure is used for heating the bed
and must be procured from stables where a number
of horses are kept that sufficient may be obtained
at one time. It is not necessary for the
small hotbed to pile the manure and turn it over
two or three times before putting it into the pit;
much time and labor is saved by putting it at once
in the pit, tramping it down as filled in until
it is within five or six inches of the level of the
ground outside. Care must be taken that it is
tramped down evenly, especially in the corners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
or it will settle unevenly and cause the soil to sink
in places. The earth may be placed on at once
if the manure is steaming when put in the pit.
Good, mellow loam, containing a portion of
humus or leaf mould is the best hotbed soil and
it should be fine and free from all roughage of
sticks and stones and hard lumps of soil. Putting
the top inch or two through a sand screen is
a good practice as this gives a fine soil suitable
for the finer seeds.</p>

<p>Usually the bed will be in condition for sowing
in twenty-four hours, if the manure is
heating well&mdash;and this can be ascertained by
thrusting a fork down into the bed and leaving
it a few moments, withdrawing and feeling of
the tines, when the temperature can be quite
accurately gauged&mdash;or a thermometer may be
forced down through the soil upon the manure for
a test. From four to five inches of soil will be
sufficient if the season is late&mdash;slightly more if
the season is early and the plants likely to remain
long in the beds, and it must be leveled off as
flat as possible so that in watering the water will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
not run and wash the seeds out of the ground.</p>

<p>The sowing of the seed is one of the fascinating
phases of gardening that every born gardener enjoys
and the watching for the breaking of the
soil with the tiny green seed leaves is a joy indeed.
Unlike open air planting, there is rarely a failure
in seed germination if good seed is used. The
ideal conditions of warm soil, mellow, moist soil
of just the right consistency; protection from
changes of weather all make for a high per cent
of plants from the sowing, and the chief difficulty
is often an embarrassment of plants&mdash;that is they
come up too thickly, a trouble that is easily obviated
by sowing quite thinly, holding back a portion
of the seed for later sowings if needed, or for
a later crop.</p>

<p>Each variety of seed must be given a little plot
of ground by itself and should be separated from
its neighbor by thin strips of wood pressed into
the soil; this not only helps in identifying plants
of similar appearance, but also prevents the washing
together of the seed when too much water is
applied. Where two or three different varieties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the same plant&mdash;as Early Dutch Cabbage, Danish
Roundhead, Early Summer, etc., are sown it will
be well to alternate the plots with some other
vegetable so as to leave no chance for mistakes in
setting out the plants later on. A row of lettuce
or radishes may be interposed if desired; at any
rate the presence of the strips of wood will aid
greatly in keeping them distinct.</p>

<p>Each plot of seeds must be plainly labeled
with thin strips of wood marked with the name
of the seed and the date of sowing. If seeds of
certain plants have been purchased of different
seedsmen it will be well to indicate the source on
the labels, in this way one can compare the fertility
of the two purchases of seed and decide
which is the more desirable.</p>

<p>There is a great difference in the germination
of different garden seeds, certain varieties appearing
in from three to five days&mdash;as cabbage,
radishes, etc. Others&mdash;like peppers, parsley and
the like&mdash;require from two to three weeks to
appear above ground and one should not lose
faith in the "Quickness" of the seed until a reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
time has elapsed, nor will it be desirable to
dig them up every day or two to see if they are
growing; this will discourage rather than accelerate
the process.</p>

<p>If the soil in the hotbed appears dry when
sowing the seed it should be carefully watered by
means of a fine-nosed watering pot or a whisk
broom dipped in water, care being taken that not
enough water is used at a time to wash the soil
or disturb the planting. If any seed is uncovered
it must be recovered. Seed sown under the
protection of sash, either in hotbed or cold frame,
does not require to be covered as deeply as when
in the open ground, often about as much soil as
will entirely cover it is sufficient, always so in
the case of fine seed which should be sown broadcast
in sections and covered by sifting fine soil or
clean sand over and pressing all down firmly with
a piece of board. Larger seeds may be sown in
drills, opened a quarter of an inch deep and the
earth drawn over them and pressed down.</p>

<p>Plants that make a rather high growth, even in
the hotbed, like tomatoes, should not be planted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
in front of lower growing things, but should
be in the rear or extend entirely across the bed;
tomatoes, for instance, are apt to overtop such
plants as peppers, which grow quite slowly in
the hotbed. Endive, parsley, lettuce and onions,
all are plants which do not assert themselves very
strongly at first and should not be crowded for
room or sunshine.</p>

<p>When all the planting is in and the soil watered,
if necessary, newspapers should be spread over
the soil and the bed closed and germination
awaited. If the sun is very hot it may be necessary
to raise the sash before the plants appear,
but where this is done care must be taken that
the papers are not disturbed by the wind, as if
blown about the soil will dry out and check or
kill germination.</p>

<p>As soon as a plot of seeds breaks ground the
little seedlings will need air and light and the
paper should be removed from this portion and
replaced on top of the glass, held in place with
pieces of wood or anything that will prevent its
blowing about; this will only be necessary until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
the plants are able to stand full sunlight, which
will be as soon as they have grown their first
pair of real leaves. As the young plants increase
in size more and more air and sunshine should be
given them and due attention to watering must
be carefully observed. Lath screens to temper
the sun will be necessary and will be needed to
replace the sash when the plants are large enough
to dispense with it during the heat of the day;
these, in turn, may be replaced by wire screens
if there is any danger of predatory cats, chickens
or children, for it is the work of but a few moments
for an entire planting to be destroyed by
any one of them. Puss likes nothing better than
to get into that nice warm hotbed and roll on the
soft warm ground and as for Biddy!</p>

<p>It is surprising the number of things that may
be started in the hotbed and transplanted into the
open ground as soon as the weather permits, thus
gaining at least a month's start in the garden. A
great many of the vegetables that are always sown
in the open ground&mdash;beets, string or lima beans,
endive, lettuce&mdash;all may be started in the hotbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and planted out and will give one very tender and
succulent vegetables to use while the main crop
is maturing from open ground sowing. Once
one has acquired the hotbed habit one will never
have quite room enough for one will always be
wanting to try something more. One of the
most satisfactory pushing forward of vegetables
is achieved in planting melons and cucumbers and
squash on pieces of sod in the hotbed. Of course
cucumbers for pickles should always be sown
rather late in the open ground but fruit for slicing
for the table may very profitably be started on
sod and transferred to the open ground when all
danger of frost is passed and so be ready a good
month sooner and what is, perhaps, quite as important,
escape the ravages of the striped cucumber
beetle, that exasperating foe to vine culture.</p>

<p>A cold wet spell at planting time often results
in a loss of the entire planting of Lima and string
beans, but if one has taken the precaution of
planting a half pint of seed in the hotbed and
transplanting them along about the twenty-first
of May, one can wait until the first of June, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
necessary, to plant the main crop and be assured
of a successful stand of plants which will bear
quite as early as if planted in unsuitable weather
and soil; this is of especial moment owing
to the high price of this class of seed; all
varieties of seeds have advanced in price but the
difference is most marked in seeds of the various
legumes&mdash;peas and beans, of all varieties which
command a price that makes especial care in their
planting advisable.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t"><span class="smcap">Cold Frames</span></p>

<p>Supplement effectively the hotbed or, in mild
climates, take their place. They are, to all effects
and purposes a hotbed&mdash;minus the heat&mdash;and so
do not require the excavation of a pit. The part
above the ground is similar to that of the hotbed,
being supplied with sash and given the same
slant to shed water and concentrate as much sunshine
as possible. For spring use it should front
the south and occupy a well-drained position,
but for mid-season use an east exposure is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
desirable. If one wishes to use it to transplant
things from the hotbed, then a temporary frame
of boards made to bolt together may be constructed
that may be taken apart and stored away
when no longer required; if used for transplanting
the sash should be in a position a week
before it is needed so that the soil may become
warm and friable, then the little plants of cabbage,
cauliflower and the like may be transferred
without any appreciable check in the growth and
what there is will be advantageous as it will result
in the formation of a mass of fibrous roots
which will give them an additional chance in the
struggle for life in the open. Even screens of
cheese cloth will give sufficient protection in any
but frosty weather and blankets may supplement
these on cold days if glass is prohibitive on account
of its excessive price.</p>

<p>A well-spaded bed of good soil, enriched with
a little well decayed manure&mdash;that from last
year's hotbed will answer, or bone meal may be
used or a commercial fertilizer, for the plants will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
need food at this stage of their growth, should be
prepared and the frame set on this or sunk a few
inches into the ground to insure warmth and prevent
the ingress of small rodents which somehow
show a peculiar penchant for hotbeds and
cold frames and have been known to destroy a
whole planting of seeds in a single night. A
little nitrate of soda scattered between the rows
of cabbage and cauliflower will work wonders in
the growth of these plants and is to be recommended
at this stage of their growth and again
when transplanted into the open ground.</p>

<p>Other forms of plant protection are found in
the frameless beds protected by lath screens;
these are used mainly during the summer months
and are especially adapted for growing pansies
from seed to be transferred to cold frames in the
fall and grown on until time to plant out in permanent
beds in spring; for growing violets in like
manner and also for starting cabbage seed to be
held over winter in cold frames for early spring
planting.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t"><span class="smcap">The Sand Box</span></p>

<p>Is used as an auxiliary to the hotbed for a
nursery for those plants which are to be used in
the house or conservatory during winter and must
be kept in a growing, but not blooming, condition
during summer and shifted from pot to pot
as occasion requires. Though mainly essential in
the growing of house plants it is often found of
much use as a place to carry on such vegetable
plants as one may desire to pot off for sale or for
stockier growth, previous to setting in the open
ground. The sand box consists of any shallow
box of sufficient size to hold a considerable number
of two to four inch pots. It should not, preferably,
be over three feet wide but may be of any
desired length. Five inches is a good depth. It
should be elevated on some kind of support, at a
convenient height to work at when sitting on a
stool or box. When used for growing house
plants it is usually placed in a rather shady spot
on the east side of the house, but if used for vegetables
it may be given a more sunny, exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
position; it should be filled with clean sand into
which the pots are plunged to their rims and the
sand is kept constantly wet. The pots should be
turned around in the sand every day or two to
prevent the roots, which escape through the hole
in the bottom of the pot, growing in the sand; to
prevent this also place a piece of broken crock or
glass over the drainage hole. In potting off
plants from the hotbed use a small thumb-pot at
first and re-pot in one a size larger as soon as the
roots form a network around the outside of the
ball of earth: this condition may be ascertained by
tapping the pot against the side of the box which
will loosen the ball of earth and allow it to drop
out on the hand. Plants that are to go into the
ground in late May will probably not require re-potting,
certainly not more than once, but this
treatment makes stocky, well-rooted plants that
command a better price than the untransplanted
plants from the beds, though there is always an
excellent market for all the products of the hotbed.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t"><span class="smcap">Sowing Seed in Flats in the House</span></p>

<p>Is the simplest, and least satisfactory form of
advance work in the garden; it belongs in the
class of being "better than nothing," but for some
plants is quite as successful as a hotbed, unfortunately
that particular class is not embraced in
a book on vegetable gardening, but belongs particularly
to flower gardening and the special sorts
dedicated to the warm conservatory and window
garden.</p>

<p>However, if one has not, and cannot achieve,
the advantage of a hotbed then one must make
the most of what is attainable and resort to flats.
These may be of any shape or size, but the usual
florists' flats&mdash;about fifteen inches wide and
twenty long and not over five inches deep&mdash;are of
a practical size for general use; narrower ones
which may be set on a window sill are also useful
but will not give a large number of plants. Very
convenient plant boxes which simulate a miniature
hotbed, being about six inches high in the
back and about four in front, of the usual flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
size and supplied with a hinged lid of glass, are
sold by the florists but are easily manufactured
at home and are better than the open flats as
they enable one to regulate moisture, the principal
trouble&mdash;owing to the dry air of the living
rooms, the shallowness of the soil, in growing
plants in flats.</p>

<p>Several holes for drainage should be made in
the bottom of the boxes and these covered with
pieces of shard or glass and the boxes filled to
within a half inch of the top with a good compost
consisting of fibrous loam&mdash;that shaved from the
bottom of sods&mdash;leaf mould, clean white sand and
a little well-rotted manure, all thoroughly mixed
and free from roughage.</p>

<p>The seeds should be broadcasted, if fine, drilled
in if coarse, and the soil pressed down snugly over
them. In the case of fine seed it is a good idea
to cover with fine white sand instead of soil as
this is less subject to the minute fungus which
causes the deadly "damping off" so destructive
to plant life and especially troublesome in growing
plants in the house.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>As in the planting in the hotbed, the seed
plots should be carefully labeled with name and
date of sowing. After planting the seeds the
flats should be set in a pan of water until the surface
looks dark but not wet. They should then
be covered with a sheet of white paper and glass
and set in a warm, sunny window until germination
takes place. Then the glass should be
raised sufficiently to admit air and the paper removed
and placed between the box and the window
or a width of cheese cloth may be interposed
between the glass and the box to temper the sunlight
until the little plants have acquired their
first pair of true leaves when they will be able to
endure more heat and air which should be steadily
increased until on mild days the window may be
opened that they may benefit by full sunshine
and air. As soon as the little plants are an inch
high, transplant into other flats, setting an inch or
more apart each way, and grow on as before or
until they again crowd each other, when they may
be transferred to small two or three inch pots and
the sand box until time to go into the ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="small">PLANTING SEED IN THE OPEN GROUND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Is</span> important for it is just the form that most
of the garden sowing will take. The sowing
of seed in hotbeds and flats in the house is of
much interest and importance, but the garden,
for the most part, will go directly into the open
ground, and upon the care and judgment with
which the planting is done will depend the success
of the season's work.</p>

<p>The ground should be in as good condition for
sowing as possible&mdash;neither too dry nor too wet.
It should, and this is of much importance, be
warm. The best of seed will not germinate if
sown in wet, cold soil, especially is this true of
peas and beans, failures with these being almost
invariably due to too much haste in planting or
unfavorable weather immediately following. It
is no unusual thing in a cold, late spring for these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
legumes to require repeated replanting and with
the enormously advanced price of all kinds of
seeds it will not pay to take too long chances by
undue haste in planting. Usually it is quite safe
to plant nearly all of the garden truck by the
tenth of May at the north but the weather for
the recent seasons has been unusual and much
loss was occasioned by adhering too closely to an
established schedule; so, if the season promises to
be in any way, except for earliness, abnormal, it
is best to go slowly and not trust all one's seed to
an initial planting but to hold a little in reserve
to replant unfilled areas. Cutworms, too, have
caused much devastation the past few seasons&mdash;usually
these are troublesome to transplanted
things, mainly cabbage, peppers and tomatoes,
but last year they destroyed beans and other
plants impartially, causing much loss.</p>

<p>In planting a seed drill attached to a hand cultivator
will be of great assistance as seed may be
drilled in rows or dropped in hills at different distances
apart so rapidly that the entire garden
may be planted in little more time than it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
to do an hundred foot row by hand, and the drill
will do it better, opening up the rows, sowing the
seed and covering all in one operation. If, however,
one is not possessed of this convenient implement
one can do very well without by removing
one hoe of the hand cultivator, or by reversing
both hoes and bringing the points together and
opening a drill to receive the seed and covering it
with the hoe or rake, or it may even be opened
with a trowel, which though laborious, is a very
effectual way.</p>

<p>The soil must always be firmed above the seed
after sowing, either by means of a flat piece of
board, with a handle on one surface or, in the
case of large seeds by tramping the rows with
the feet; this firming of the soil is most important,
it brings the soil close about the seed so that
the first little root&mdash;a very tiny, delicate little
root, feeling its way about in search of nourishment
can come at once into contact with the warm
soil and obtain the food and moisture so critically
needed at this juncture of its little life. The
firming of the soil conserves the moisture, preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the entrance of dry, hot air, and to obtain
this further the ground after being tramped
down should be gone over lightly with rake or
trowel and a dust-mulch produced. In fact, all
through one's gardening processes one must keep
the dust-mulch in evidence for it means conservation
of moisture and fertility and freedom from
weeds.</p>

<p>Seeds of different sizes, hardness and germination
qualities, require different treatment; fine
seeds may be sown in shallow drills, scattering
seeds whose germinary power is known to be low
or questionable quite thickly in the drills; beets
are usually sown quite freely, while radishes&mdash;nearly
every seed of which may be trusted to
grow&mdash;may be scattered at about the distance
they are wanted to stand in the rows; beans, too,
may be dropped at about the distance they will
require&mdash;six inches or more apart for limas, and
as these seeds are sensitive to cold and dampness
it is a wise precaution to set them on edge,
eye down, in the drills. Seeds that germinate
slowly, like peas, are hastened considerably by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
being soaked over night in warm water, and many
seeds that require considerable time to start are
hastened if warm water be poured into the
trenches before the soil is filled in; this is especially
beneficial in very dry soil where germination
might otherwise be delayed until after a rain.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="Beds" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="xsmall"><i>An orderly arrangement of garden beds</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>It is not necessary that new seed be purchased
every spring; if one has seed of his own saving
so that its age is known one can use it with confidence.
Seed purchased of the seedsman is more
or less problematical, but is usually supposed to
be of the previous season's crop, especially is this
true of those seedsmen who produce their own
seed on farms located in different sections of the
country, and whose seeds are usually very reliable.
However there are many seedsmen, or
jobbers, who purchase the bulk of their seeds in
the open market and cannot guarantee the quality
in any way. It is always a great mistake
to purchase cheap seed; it is better to buy seed of
a reputable seedsman who puts his name and reputation
back of it, though the price may be considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
higher than one would pay for the same
seed of the local store or seedsman.</p>

<p>Where one has sufficient old seed of different
kinds it is a good idea to test them out during
the late days of winter and so ascertain their fitness
for use. The testing is a simple matter,
warmth and moisture being all that is required.
A long tray covered with an inch of sand kept
moist may be marked off in squares and the seed
it is desired to test scattered evenly over the surface,
labeling or numbering each square, then a
thick piece of flannel should be wet in warm water
and placed snugly over all and the tray put
in a warm place&mdash;back of the furnace, over a
radiator or on the back of the kitchen reservoir
if a fire is kept there all the time, until the seeds
germinate; it will then be seen what proportion
germinate and how freely one will need to sow
in order to obtain a good stand of plants. If the
supply of seed is large a germination test of
seventy-five per cent. will justify its use but if
there is only a limited supply it will be better to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
purchase fresh seed or at least sufficient to supplement
the home supply. It is always worth
while to save one's own seed if the vegetables have
exceptionally good qualities; this insures trueness
to name and often an improvement over the parent
stock; it is not, however, desirable where a
number of varieties of any vegetable is grown in
the same garden as the seed is quite certain to be
mixed and the good qualities of the parent stock
to be lost.</p>

<p>In sowing seed in the open ground cultivation
should begin as soon as the seed is sown and covered.
In the case of large seed which is tramped
down in the rows and covered an inch or more it
is not always necessary to rake over the rows
for a dust-mulch, rarely if it is likely to rain immediately.
Under this condition the rows will
be quite distinct and as soon as the rain is over
and the ground slightly dried off the scuffle-hoe
may be run along the rows restoring the dust-mulch,
or creating one. Where the planting is
shallow it is an excellent plan to drop radish
seeds at intervals along the row as these will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
appear in from three to five days, thus marking
the rows so that there will be no difficulty in following
them. When this is done it will not be
necessary to use ground especially for planting
radishes so that there will be a saving in room
that may be utilized to advantage for other vegetables.
Lettuce, too, may be grown to advantage
by planting a short strip of seed at the end of
rows of other vegetables, where full rows are not
required, as this saves space in the garden and
the lettuce if placed at the ends of the rows nearest
the house is easily accessible and does away
with the necessity of walking on the garden after
it has been cultivated, a thing the careful gardener
avoids.</p>

<p>With the intensive gardening practised on the
small plot where the vegetables are planted in
close rows from a foot to two feet apart, the
ground should be at all times in a fine tilth, free
from unworked strips and trodden paths. It is
of little value to cut off the weeds with the hoe
or cultivator if they are to be trodden back in
the ground and so given a new lease of life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
scuffle-hoe is a real boon to the gardener in obviating
this difficulty as in using it one walks backwards,
pushing the hoe from one instead of drawing
it towards one as is done with the common
garden hoe; this leaves a beautiful, clean tilth,
absolutely free from trampled areas and nothing
cut off by the hoe will take on a new lease of
life over night. More real work can be accomplished
by the use of the scuffle than with any
other tool in the garden; it does not supplant
altogether the wheel cultivator but does its work
when used alternately with it; the cultivator
breaking up the soil to a greater depth, and more
rapidly than the scuffle, but the latter destroys
far more thoroughly all weeds and reaches closer
to the plants, slipping underneath the leaves and
close to the stems and routing out any and all
weeds lurking there. The cultivator leaves the
ground in ridges and aerates it, the scuffle levels
it again and produces a fine dust-mulch which will
preserve the moisture until another rain calls for
the use of the cultivator.</p>

<p>Unless the season is a very rainy one, one good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
cultivation a week, either with scuffle or cultivator,
will keep the garden in excellent shape, but
every rain MUST be followed by cultivation of
some sort, for there is great loss of moisture if
this is not done and weeds follow quickly after
rain.</p>

<p>The various weeds with which the garden is
afflicted come at separate intervals&mdash;not all together,
and when one has eradicated one set of
weeds there is usually a brief interval before the
appearance of the next detachment. But one
must have them continually in mind and keep
a sharp lookout for the first tiny seedlings and
destroy them before they have made even one
pair of true leaves. Working around individual
plants with a trowel or hand weeder has this advantage
that it spies out the enemy before it
would attract attention if the rows were worked
with hoe or cultivator. The severe thinning that
such plants as beets, carrots, endive, salsify, onions
and the like require clears the rows of weeds and
helps materially in general cultivation. This
thinning out should always be done prior to cultivating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
between the rows, then the paths are
left clear and untrodden and the garden is a delight
to look upon. A basket should be carried
along the rows to drop the plants removed so
that they may be out of the way when ready
to run the cultivator. Nearly all plants which
require thinning may be used in setting out fresh
rows of vegetables and where there are vacant
places in the rows the spaces may be filled up with
plants removed from too crowded areas.</p>

<p>The first weeds to appear in the spring are the
chickweed and the malice<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>2</sup></a> that has remained over
from the previous year, being a perennial and a
very hardy and persistent one; these two are
ploughed under and give little or no trouble if
the work has been well done. The new crop does
not appear until late in the season&mdash;usually in
July. Purslaine comes along in June and soon
after appears that particular pest of the garden&mdash;red
root. All these are very easily eradicated
when small but the red root is an exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
hard weed to pull once it has got a grip on the
ground and it must be taken out root and all
or it will come up again with not one but several
stout stalks, and a more tenacious hold than ever
on the soil; it is one of the weeds which are constantly
eluding detection until they have gained
several inches in height when they defy the hoe
and cultivator and call for strenuous hand work!</p>

<p>Many of the garden weeds may be utilized for
feeding stock. Belgian hares are fond of the
fresh green leaves of malice and pigs enjoy both
that and the purslaine and as the former comes at
a time when there is little green feed available
for the hares it may be pulled and fed rather
than turned under. Ragweed is relished by
horses and they will frequently go into a patch
of it and eat it in preference to good clover growing
near by.</p>

<span class="small">TRANSPLANTING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Transplanting</span> is one test of a good
gardener, another is the care of the plants
after they are gotten into the ground&mdash;the careful
cultivation that forbids a weed to show its
head above ground, or a crust to form on the soil
after a rain; these two successful operations spell
success in the garden&mdash;their absence failure.</p>

<p>For several days before the young plants in
the hotbed are to be put into the ground they
should be hardened by leaving the sash entirely
off and by occasionally withholding water
that they may be accustomed to the irregular
water supply of the open ground, but the beds
should be well watered the night before transplanting
that the plants may absorb enough moisture
to carry them through the ordeal of transplanting
and that the soil may have sufficient
moisture to adhere to the roots.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>The planting lines in the garden should be
drawn and the holes for those plants which are
to stand some distance apart&mdash;such as tomatoes,
peppers and the like, should be already dug and,
where extra fertilizing is called for, the hills enriched
with a good spadeful of well decayed
manure and the ground all ready for the
plants. In this way transplanting will go forward
with the least possible delay and the plants
will suffer little, if any, from the change.</p>

<p>It is not at all necessary to wait for a rainy
spell as so many think desirable; the most successful
planting can be done on a clear, bright
day if the work is handled properly; indeed this
is just the weather that gives best results, a period
of rainy weather with cloudy intervals between is
also favorable except for the discomfort of working
in the wet but when planting time comes
one must not think too much of one's personal
comfort,&mdash;it is up to one to get things into the
ground and growing; we can be comfortable later
on when there is time for it.</p>

<p>A rainy spell, broken by hot, sunshiny, muggy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
days is of all times the worst for transplanting;
plants wilt and die in spite of one, fairly cooked
by the hot steam engendered by the rain and sunshine,
and such planting weather should be
avoided unless the season is late and the planting
urgent. Only as many plants should be lifted
at one time as can be put into the ground before
they wilt. Do not try to lift plants separately
but lift them in clumps, pressing the
trowel well down below the roots and lifting the
plants with as little disturbance as possible&mdash;never
pull up the plants by the tops as one sometimes
sees done; this strips off the tender, fibrous
roots on which the plant depends for gathering
its food. The tap root which remains has little
foraging value, it serves, principally, to hold the
plant in the ground while the fine, lateral roots
are busy collecting food to feed the growing top;
if these little feeding roots are destroyed the plant
must make a new supply before top growth can
be resumed.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to separate the plants at once
but carefully release each plant as it is required;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
in this way they retain their freshness and loss
from wilting is minimized.</p>

<p>Make a hole large and deep enough for the
roots, setting them deeper than they were in the
hotbed, and fill in part of the earth, pressing it
down firmly, fill in the hole with water and when
it has seeped away fill in the remainder of the
earth, leaving it dry, fine and smooth about the
plant. Each of these three operations may be
completed for the entire row of plants before
going on to the next: the plants set in the hole
and the first earth drawn up, then all the holes
filled with water and by the time the last hole
is filled the first will be ready for final filling in
with earth. This is a more efficient method than
to complete one hole at a time and keeps the
plants in better shape.</p>

<p>When the whole planting of one variety of
vegetable is completed go over them carefully,
noting any wet spots that may appear on the
surface and cover them with more dry earth.
Remember that it is upon the integrity of the
dry mulch that the success of the planting depends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Do not try to protect the plants in any
way; if sufficient water has been placed in the
hole, the earth firmed sufficiently and an efficient
dry mulch provided the plant will be much better
off than if protected in any way. Do not water
after transplanting until the plants have become
established and need it. If for any cause some
of the plants show signs of wilting while the dust-mulch
is still perfect a hole should be made at
one side of the plant and water poured in, recovering
the spot with dry earth. If it rains
immediately after planting, clearing off with fair
weather, the beds must be gone over with the
scuffle-hoe to replace the dust-mulch as soon as
it can be worked to advantage. One has only to
bear in mind that the secret of successful planting
is moisture at the roots and dry earth above to
succeed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="small">GARDEN TOOLS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Are</span> so important in the proper care of the
garden and for the ease with which it
may be worked that only the best should be considered;
the best, however, need not be the most
expensive, but they should be the best adapted
to the work to be attempted. It is not necessary
that their number be large, indeed, the number of
tools really indispensable is relatively small, but
definite. A good steel garden rake will be one of
the first tools required and this should be of the
steel variety, neither too light nor too heavy. Get
a good spade with a "D" handle that fits the hand
and foot. A wheelbarrow of the wooden sideboard
construction will also be required; to these
will be added a garden line and a hand cultivator
and as this is the most expensive and important
tool its selection is of much moment. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
three forms of wheel hoes on the market: the
high single wheel, the medium wheel and the low
double wheel made to straddle the rows. The
double wheeled machines have the advantage of
working each side of the row, close to the plants
as well as between the rows and if the hoes or
cultivator teeth are properly adjusted will do
twice the work of a single wheel. Some of the
double wheeled cultivators are readily changed
into single wheels by removing one wheel. Too
high a wheel is not desirable, and as the wheel is
the part of the cultivator that bears most of the
strain it should be of substantial construction.
Most of the machines on the market have as attachments
a set of plough blades, four harrow
teeth and hoe. My own&mdash;a Planet Junior, two-wheel
cultivator has also an attachment for creating
a dust-mulch, similar to a scuffle-hoe, but
this was made especially for the machine by a
local blacksmith and is a very useful addition to
the outfit.</p>

<p>If one does not object to the extra expense a
seeding attachment can be added that will minimize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the work of planting the garden. A good
machine with seeder that will plant in rows and
with all the attachments can be purchased for
$16.00 or the same machine which will sow in rows
and also in hills 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 inches apart
can be purchased for $19.00 and is a good buy,
for a good machine of this kind, if properly cared
for, kept under shelter when not in use, oiled
occasionally, the attachments kept sharpened and
given an occasional coat of paint as required is
good for twenty years at least. There are still
cheaper machines on the market, single wheel
implements with the usual attachments, that will
do good work, for as little as $5.25 and $7.50, and
two wheelers at $10.00 and one single wheel that
is especially designed for wear, with an iron instead
of wire wheel, built for service at $7.00.</p>

<p>To this assortment of tools should be added a
straight edged garden hoe, or any preferred
shaped edge, and a scuffle-hoe. This last is obtainable
in 6, 8, 9, and 10 inch blade and costs
ninety cents for the 6 inch and $1.00 for the
9 inch size; the ten inch does more rapid work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and can be run between rows planted twelve to
fifteen inches wide, clearing the entire space between
in one operation so that one goes over the
ground very rapidly. Useful in any one's hands
it is pre&euml;minently a woman's tool, no lame and
aching back accompanies its use as one does not
lean over in hoeing as with the common garden
hoe. If I could have but one tool to garden with
I think it would be a scuffle-hoe, for no other tool
will keep the garden so free from weeds. With
the common garden hoe my paths through the
garden are usually marked by the wreckage of
plants, for use as much care as I can sooner or
later I get to hoeing too vigorously and off goes
a cabbage, tomato or onion. The scuffle-hoe
does not seem to arouse an excess of energy; one
goes along smoothly and serenely, leaving clean
tilth and undepleted rows of vegetables in one's
wake and looking back at the end of each row sees
that it is good.</p>

<p>A trowel&mdash;or a number of them is better&mdash;is
a very necessary implement and because one is
prone to mislay trowels, or leave one at the hotbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
when going for plants it is well to have one for
each place and either to attach it to a string to
one's belt&mdash;if only one is possessed, or to attach
a bright red cloth to the handle that it may be
identified if dropped among weeds, loose earth
or grass for the trowel seems to have a chameleon
like nature and takes on the color of its surroundings
and becomes invisible to the eye once
it has left one's hand. The bright color will save
many moments wasted time in looking for it and
has proved its worth on more than one occasion.
In purchasing a trowel selection should be made
of the sort that has the blade and handle in one;
this construction, if of steel, will insure a tool that
will last until worn out by use, the trowel with
a wooden handle has usually a flimsy blade and
a handle that is not dependable.</p>

<p>A garden line and reel that may be purchased
for $1.75 is a convenient thing to have
when laying out lines for planting, but a very
good substitute can be produced from an old
broom handle and a ball of butcher's twine
by sawing the handle into two eighteen inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
lengths, boring a hole in one end of each
piece and sharpening the other end, passing the
ends of the cord through the hole and making a
knot too large to slip through the hole, makes
the line more convenient to handle than if tied
around the stick, as it cannot slip in winding, or
any ingenious boy with simple tools can copy the
regular reel in a short time. A very simple, home
made tool for marking rows equal distances apart
consists of a straight pole of wood with a cross
piece at one end, fifteen, eighteen or twenty-four
inches on each end from the center pole and provided
with triangular pieces at the ends and in
the center for markers, or wooden rake teeth may
be set in holes provided for them. This is drawn
along the ground and makes one, two or three
rows at one operation. The construction of two
or three of these markers is a short job and they
save a considerable amount of time in laying out
the garden. The twenty-four inch marker can
also be used for marking the twelve inch rows
by adjusting the pegs. The hand cultivators
with seeding attachments have also a marker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
which while seeding one row marks out the following
one.</p>

<p>A watering pot and some kind of spraying
apparatus for the use of insecticides will also be
needed. A rubber bulb with perforated metal
top and bent neck, such as is used for spraying
house plants is an excellent thing to use where
the use of wood alcohol is indicated. Paris green
may be applied from a fine-nosed watering pot if
liquid form is used or if a dry application is preferred
a common mason quart can with the porcelain
lining of the top removed and the latter
punched full of holes makes an effective distributor
when filled with dry lime or flour and Paris
green or hellebore. I have never seen a hand
atomizer or spray pump or powder blow gun
that was a particle of use; the tyrian sprinklers,
however, are practical and useful for spraying in
a small way for aphis, red spider and for squash
bugs. A knapsack or auto-sprayer with galvanized
iron reservoir can be purchased for $6.25,
with brass reservoir for $9.50 and is a good investment
where there are small fruits&mdash;currants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
gooseberries, and small trees&mdash;and is profitable
for a neighborhood garden investment if one does
not wish to go to the entire expense for a small
garden. Something of the kind is indispensable
where potatoes are grown, though for a small
patch hand picking of bugs is preferable. A garden
fork will be needed in the fall when the potatoes,
carrots, parsnips and other root vegetables
are to be dug and as wide a one as available should
be purchased as the more roots one can lift at a
time the more quickly the work will progress.
A spading fork is very useful in the garden in
loosening the earth about plants, planted a considerable
distance apart, when heavy rain has
beaten the earth down hard and is especially useful
for cultivating about berry plants, young
fruit trees and grape vines, where the use of a
spade would injure the roots of the plant.</p>

<p>A manure barrel, while not a tool, is a valuable
accessory of the garden and its use will notably
increase the yield of certain vegetables. A large
lard barrel is a good sort to use and it must be
prepared by burning out the lard which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
likely adhere to it, or it may be washed out with
strong soapsuds or lye&mdash;a more tedious process.
A hole large enough to receive a wooden spigot
should be bored a couple of inches above the bottom
of the barrel. The barrel should be placed
on a firm support&mdash;a heavy wooden box answering
the purpose, high enough to allow a watering
pot to stand beneath the spigot; three or four
inches of straw are then placed in the bottom of
the barrel for drainage and should come well
above the spigot hole; the barrel is then filled
full of manure and water turned in until brimming
full; a close cover to exclude flies completes
the preparation. When the manure liquid is
required it is only necessary to place the watering
can in position, open the spigot and allow the
liquid to run until the can is full. After drawing
off a supply of liquid an equal amount of water
should be returned to the barrel to keep it always
full and ready for use. When first established
the liquid will be very strong and it will be best
to dilute it, using half water and half liquid, and
liquid manure should never be used when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
ground is dry, but always after a rain or artificial
watering.</p>

<p>A barrel once filled can be used over and over
again until the liquid begins to appear pale in
color, when the manure should be removed from
the barrel and fresh supplied. If there is only
a limited demand for this fertilizer, one filling
will last out the summer, but where there are a
number of uses for it it will need one or more
renewals. Any kind of animal manure may be
used&mdash;that from the horse stable being usually
the most available but use may be made of the
manure from the cow stable, the sheep pen or
the rabbit hutches, but not from the poultry
houses as this form is too strong to be used in
liquid form, though its use in dry form is excellent
for many vegetables.</p>

<p>Tomato supports are among the useful adjuncts
of the garden and very good home made
ones can be provided by utilizing the wire hoops
that come around barrels, stapling them to four
stout stakes; by their use a considerably larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
number of plants can be grown in a given area
and the care and gathering of the fruit will be
far pleasanter than where the vines are allowed
to lie on the ground.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="small">HOLDING AND INCREASING THE FERTILITY<br />
OF THE SOIL</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> is no one thing that the gardener
so needs to keep always in mind of more
importance than that the soil needs additional fertility;
it does not matter how good it may have
been originally or how good it was last year; this
year it must have returned to it the food that was
taken from it last year by the crop that was grown
upon it. Any soil that is not virgin soil&mdash;soil that
has never been used, and that sort of soil is not
available in towns and villages if, indeed, it is
anywhere in an old, settled country like ours&mdash;must
have returned to it, year after year, an equivalent
of the fertility extracted from it in growing
the previous season's crop. It may be that
the loss of many seasons must be made good, it
may be that the soil was originally deficient in
many, or only one, of the elements that make fertility;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
probably it will lack that most important
element of productive soil&mdash;humus. Humus, be
it understood, is that element in the soil that
causes it to appear dark. What it really consists
of is decayed vegetable matter and it is always
found forming the top soil of virgin, or uncultivated
land. It is present in large amounts in
woodlands where the falling leaves and surface
growth lie on the ground, year after year, and decay
and form what is technically known as leaf
mould. We know how admirably it is adapted
to the growing of house plants, and its value is
often erroneously attributed to the plant food it is
supposed to contain, but its great value is not so
much in its food content as its influence on the
soil with which it is combined; by its presence it
makes the soil retentive of moisture and this
moisture in turn unlocks the chemical elements
of the soil so that they become available for food.
Soils that are deficient of humus, though otherwise
fertile, dry out so badly in summer that unless
artificially watered, they will produce little,
and even where a sufficient water supply is available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the result will fall far short of what would
have been produced were the supply of humus
sufficient.</p>

<p>Fortunately there are ways of restoring the
humus to worn out soils and on the small area
of the kitchen garden the process presents little
if any difficulty. The most readily available
source of humus is found in a liberal application
of barnyard manure; this for the quickest and
most satisfactory results should be well rotted,
but not fired or leached&mdash;that is, it should have
been saved in such a way that the rain has not
washed the fertility out of it in the form of
liquid manure, or lack of moisture caused it to
heat and burn. The most satisfactory method
of handling manure is under shelter in a cement
bottom pit with a depression or well for the liquid
contents to drain into; this is seldom available in
the town or city garden, but an enclosed pen for
the manure, where it can be kept in a compact
pile and where water can be turned on often
enough to prevent firing, answers very well; better
still is it to draw the manure on the land as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
is produced; this, too, is seldom practicable in the
small garden, but a heavy dressing of manure can
always be applied in the fall, spread evenly and
allowed to lie and rot over winter and be turned
under in the spring while it is wet. The rapidity
of decay, and hence the availability of the plant
food it contains of any vegetable matter turned
under in a garden is greatly increased if it is
turned under wet, dry material turned under
rots very slowly and may be a detriment rather
than a help to the crops that are grown over it
that season. If a plant sends its roots down into
a mass of dry leaves, straw or other material it
has no chance to gain either moisture or nourishment
and must exist on what little its surface
roots can extract from the top layer of soil.</p>

<p>In spading manure into a small strip of land
or a bed I usually allow at least one large wheelbarrow
to a square yard and this proportion
should be observed for the whole garden. Practically
about twenty tons of manure per acre
will be required for good results, market gardeners
often use far more, or a large, two horse load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
for a strip of land fifty feet square. If the land
is light and sandy the manure should be well
rotted but on clay or heavy tenacious soil fresh
manure gives better results as it breaks apart the
particles of the soil, by the expansion caused by
heating, and adds sand, which is also a mechanical
disintegrant, permanent in effect.</p>

<p>There is another way in which humus can be
immediately supplied and that is by applications
of woods earth or marsh earth-muck, directly to
the soil. Where a supply of either form of humus
is available it pays well to employ it. For a
number of years I made a practice of keeping
track of available sources of humus, noting as
I drove about the country where new land was
being broken up and especially where marsh
land was being ditched and drained; then in
the spring I would engage the owner to haul
me as many loads as I required, but as the time
passed it became necessary to go farther and
farther afield until the cost of hauling became prohibitive.</p>

<p>There has been considerable discussion of late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
in agricultural papers as to the value of raw
muck when applied to the land. Muck in its
unsubdued state is more of a fuel-peat than a
fertilizer; it needs to be subdued by lying out
over winter so that the frost may disintegrate
it and make it available for plant food, but I
have found that it may be made immediately
available in its raw state by burying or covering
it with a layer of soil to exclude the air and retain
moisture; in this form it gradually changes
to humus and plants grown in it do exceedingly
well. Among interesting experiments conducted
to test its use was this conclusive one: deep
holes were dug in beds that were to be planted
to bedding plants&mdash;cannas, salvias and the like;
these holes were filled with the raw muck and
covered with the soil of the garden and into this
the plants were set and the usual culture followed;
the results were surprising; salvias, that
ordinarily made a growth of about thirty inches
reached the astonishing height of nearly five feet
and were a mass of blooms; still more astonishing
results were discovered in clearing the beds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the fall when it was found that the muck had
practically disappeared, the plants having literally
consumed it. Left on the surface of the
soil the muck would have dried into a hard, intractable
mass, fit only for fuel.</p>

<p>If one had a supply of raw muck available and
wished to apply it to the garden it could be handled
by following the plough and shovelling the
muck into the open furrow; the next furrow
turned would cover it. It would be of much
benefit and would be turned to the surface again
in the following spring ploughing. This should
not be expected to take the place of barnyard
manure, as it would lack some elements contained
in that but it could be combined with such commercial
fertilizers as the condition of the soil
might suggest&mdash;lime, for instance, might be indicated
by the sourness of the soil. If sorrel is
plentiful on the ground it is a pretty good indication
that lime is in order, but one need not depend
upon its presence for data as these may be quickly
attained by the use of blue litmus paper which
may be obtained of any druggist. Its use is simple;
if the soil is very wet, simply pressing a strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of litmus paper down into it and examining it
in an hour's time will indicate, according as it
retains its color or turns pink&mdash;the acid reaction&mdash;the
presence of acidity in the soil, or a cupful of
the soil may be mixed with water to a thin paste
and the paper inserted with the same diagnosis.</p>

<p>Lime is more in the form of a stimulant or indirect
fertilizer than a real plant-food; it is in a
medical sense an alterative, changing the nature
of the soil. It not only sweetens, but mechanically,
it binds loose soil, but flocculates or opens
up tenacious clayey soils, affording freer passage
of air and water and lessening the tendency to
wash. It should be applied, on light, sandy soils
at the rate of about five hundred pounds per acre
or twenty-five pounds to every fifty square feet
of garden plot; ten times this amount can be
used on a heavy clay soil, but liming of the soil
is not necessary every year, about once in five
being desirable, so that considered as an expense
it is nearly negligible. Slaked lime is best, and
wood ashes, which contain about thirty-four per
cent. of lime, are valuable aids in building up the
fertility of the soil. They should not, however, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
mixed with the manure or applied at the same
time as they tend to release the ammonia contained
in the manure and as ammonia spells
nitrate&mdash;the most costly of all our commercial
fertilizers&mdash;the ashes should rather be broadcasted
over the ground after the manure is turned
in and then mixed with the soil by dragging and
harrowing.</p>

<p>There are fourteen different chemical elements
that are necessary for plant growth&mdash;carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur,
chlorine, silicon, calcium, iron, potassium,
sodium, magnesium and manganese; the first
four are derived directly or indirectly from the
air, the remainder from the soil. Virgin soil contains
all these soil-derived elements in available
form and in sufficient quantities for plant growth,
and it has the power to absorb the elements which
are derived from the air, but our short sighted
methods of soil cultivation, or robbery, deplete
the soil of some of its elements faster than it can
convert them into available food for the plants.
Liberal applications of manure replace the loss
more quickly and economically than any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
treatment and if this is supplemented with such
chemical elements as the soil may seem to be
particularly in need of the fertility of the soil
will be assured.</p>

<p>The most economical and practical treatment
of the soil would be through the analysis of the
soil by a soil chemist; this can readily be done by
sending a sample of the soil to your state agricultural
college which will analyze and advise
as to its requirements, or a sample can be given
to your county agent who will attend to it and
advise you. In this way one works intelligently
and wastes neither time nor money in experiments
with no definite aim.</p>

<p>Not all of the fourteen different chemical elements
required for plant food need to be artificially
supplied; there are but three important
elements which we need to consider in this connection&mdash;nitrogen,
phosphoric acid and potash
and only one of these may be lacking; a soil analysis
will indicate which one. Nitrogen is the
most expensive of the three; it is available, commercially,
in three forms&mdash;organic nitrogen,
ammonia and nitrates. The organic nitrogen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
commonly and most economically derived from
tankage and dried blood&mdash;by-products of slaughter-houses&mdash;dried
fish, and refuse from fish canneries
and cottonseed meal; they contain, approximately&mdash;in
dried blood, ten to fifteen per
cent.; tankage, seven to nine; dried fish, seven
to eight; cottonseed meal, six to seven per cent.
These decay rapidly when added to the soil and
are particularly valuable when applied to light
soils, where nitrates or ammonia leach too rapidly
and should not be applied until the crops
are up and growing. They make available during
their processes of fermentation the phosphoric
acid and potash already present in the soil. Sulphate
of ammonia, containing about twenty per
cent. of nitrogen is a valuable chemical form
in which to secure nitrogen as it does not leach
from the soil as nitrate of soda does and so can be
made available by the plant without loss.</p>

<p>Phosphoric acid is found commercially in the
form of superphosphates; these come from phosphate
rocks and are first ground, then treated
with sulphuric acid. Bone is rich in phosphoric
acid and is a very excellent form in which to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
this element to the garden, as it is obtained in
several forms&mdash;raw bone, coarsely ground, fine
ground and bone meal. One may by applying two
or more grades secure the fertility of the garden
for several years as raw bone decays slowly and
will give results for a period of four years while
bone meal is immediately available. Potash is
most economically supplied by applications of
wood ashes. But it must be borne in mind that
the use of commercial fertilizers is not intended
to replace that of barnyard manure, but rather
to supplement it until the soil has regained what
it has lost by poor management. Commercial
fertilizers will of themselves produce a crop, but
it is at the expense of the after-fertility of the
land, just as the application of the whip will spur
a jaded horse to one more final effort. Liberal
applications of manure, leaf mould or muck and
bone meal will bring any land that has soil at all,
up to a satisfactory condition of fertility in a
very few years.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary to go far afield for the
humus for so small a piece of land as a kitchen
garden for the material for the finest kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
mould lies right at hand in every bit of outdoors.
What nature does in a field and woods she will
do in one's dooryard if one will only watch her
methods and co-operate with her. In the woods,
for instance, she shakes down the ripe leaves from
the trees, cuts with frost and age the undergrowth
and sends the wind to drift them into piles where
she waters and compacts them until in process
of time they lose their identity as leaves and
plants and become a fine, black mould, fine and
warm to the touch and blended with a clean,
sharp, white sand, or silicate. To imitate her
methods successfully we have only to collect the
dead leaves in the fall instead of wastefully burning
them, pile them in a heap in some convenient
place; surround them with a frame to keep them
from being distributed about the premises by
fowls or wind and to the nucleus thus formed
add any waste matter&mdash;animal or vegetable&mdash;that
will decay, about the place&mdash;the weeds from
the garden, the wastings from the house and
laundry. It is amazing, once one has started
to conserve fertility, how much one can find to
add to this compost heap; I recall that one spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
from a well-tended compost heap and one horse
stable, I had hauled on to the garden ten large,
two-horse loads of fertilizer, and put the garden
in excellent shape, and not only this,&mdash;it had kept
the premises tidy as nothing else would have
done. The gatherings of the summer and fall
will, by spring, have rotted down into available
form and the action of the soil, sun and rain will
complete the process.</p>

<p>The growing of pet stock on a place adds so
greatly to the upkeep of the land that it constitutes
an object in itself. Poultry is an abundant
source of manure which may be composted in
barrels with alternate layers of soil, of lime or
of any absorbent material or may be piled on the
compost heap and mixed with the vegetable matter.
To this will be added the litter from the
hen house floors which is rich in droppings and
full of earth and ground up leaves and straw.
But another source of manure, not enough considered,
is found in the droppings from the rabbit
hutches. If one raises Belgian hares, as every
one who wishes to conserve meat, should, one
will find that, in addition to a supply of delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
meat, one has also produced a valuable garden
asset in the form of a highly concentrated
manure; one will also find that one has practically
done away with all waste from the garden
as the hares will have consumed all the unusable
parts of the vegetables&mdash;all such early things that
run to seed, as lettuce, endive, swiss chard and
the like. A large part of the weeds incident to
a garden will also be consumed if pulled and
offered them, thus minimizing the weed growth
for the coming year, as every weed consumed
means just so many less to appear the following
year. It will be many years before the lesson
of the home garden so insistently brought before
us by the war will be lost, but we shall not have
gained the full measure of its lesson if we do
not realize that the critical shortage of meat
is not up to the farmer and stockman altogether,
but is a matter for each individual householder to
adjust by producing, as far as his environment
will permit, his own meat supply, by raising
chickens and hares if only room for small stock is
available, and pork if it is possible to find room
and feed for a pig&mdash;and a pig does not require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
a great amount of room&mdash;a six by eight pen will
do and a paddock, with grass and fresh water,
which need not be more than two rods square,
and reasonable attention to sanitation will render
him a contented and unobjectionable member of
the family and a very savory and profitable member,
too, come butchering time. These three
things should go hand in hand;&mdash;A garden to
produce vegetables for the family; live stock to
consume the waste from the garden and live stock
to furnish fertility for the garden; these three
spell fertility for the soil and prosperity for the
family.</p>

<p>Where the supply of manure is limited so that
the entire garden area cannot be covered, quite
as good returns may be secured by following the
plough with a load of any manure available, and
dropping it in the furrow that will correspond
with the planting row&mdash;if for corn, every three
feet of furrows, setting stakes to indicate the fertilised
strips. In a small garden fertiliser may
be trundled along in a wheelbarrow and shovelled
in with fork or spade. This is an excellent plan
in preparing ground for peas.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="small">ASPARAGUS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Is</span> one of the garden assets. Once established
an asparagus bed is good for a lifetime, almost;
certainly it is a permanent feature of the
garden, showing little if any deterioration if well
cared for and kept free from weeds.</p>

<p>The starting of an asparagus bed is not the
serious undertaking it was a few years ago, as
the deep planting then thought so necessary is
seldom practised now; instead it is thought sufficient
to open a furrow&mdash;with the plough, if the
planting is large, with the spade, if small&mdash;set the
plants and fill enough earth to cover the crown
of the plant, and, as growth starts, to gradually
fill up the furrow until the ground is level. The
ground should be of the best and heavily fertilised
before planting, for asparagus is a gross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
feeder and an additional application of coarse
ground bone in each hill is well worth while as
it furnishes food for two or three years independently
of such annual dressing as the bed may
receive.</p>

<p>For garden culture where hand cultivation is
to be practised, the plants may be set in hills
two or three feet apart each way, leaving room
to cultivate between each way for the first few
years. Two year old roots are the best to use
and in planting a little mound of earth should
be made in each hill, the roots of the plant spread
out around this so that the earth will fit in beneath,
close to the under side of the crown, then
the earth should be firmed about the roots, a
handful of bone meal sprinkled over the soil and
the remainder of the soil filled in. Asparagus
beds may be set in spring or fall; good results
follow either setting. The asparagus bed must
be kept free of weeds and grass from the start
as once allowed to become infested with foul seed
and grass it is a very discouraging proposition.
One of the worst weeds to combat is the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
asparagus plants which come up every year from
self-sown seed; to avoid this the tops should be
cut, as soon as the berries are red, and burned.
If the tops are burned on the bed the resulting
ashes will be of benefit. It has been my observation
for many years that the spots where the
tops were burned always gave finer stalks than
the rest of the bed; this suggests the application
of wood ashes as a top dressing after the dressing
of manure, which should be applied every
spring, has been worked into the soil. A heavy
covering of barnyard manure may be applied in
the fall and spaded under in the spring, or it
may be applied in February; if this is not feasible
it is an excellent plan to spade into the space
between the hills any available manure&mdash;poultry,
rabbit or sheep or stable manure that is well
rotted. The space between the rows, or paths,
should not be broken up when this is done as, if
unbroken and hard, it is easier to keep the beds
clean and an application of some good herbicide
may even be used to keep down weeds here.
When the bed has been thoroughly spaded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
enriched in this way in the early part of the
season I have found the after care of the bed
very much more successful than when all over
culture was attempted.</p>

<p>The variety to plant is largely a matter of
taste&mdash;some prefer the green, some the white
grasses. Lately a preference is being shown for
the green. These will always be preferred by
those who like a tender asparagus. The white
sorts&mdash;Bonvilete and Argenteuile&mdash;are unbelievably
tough as they appear in the market though
beautifully white and of mammoth proportions
that make them very attractive; possibly if cut,
as the green grasses are, just below the level of
the ground they would prove more edible. All
asparagus is tough below the ground, green as
well as white, and, for this reason, should not be
cut much lower than the surface.</p>

<p>Of the green grasses Conover's Colossal and
Dreer's Eclipse are excellent sorts, and Columbian
Mammoth White is a white variety that is
good.</p>

<p>If one wishes young plants for setting one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
obtain them very easily by cutting the tops of
asparagus when the berries are nearly ripe and
piling them in some convenient place where the
ground is mellow and free from weeds and grass
and leaving them undisturbed for a year; the
seeds will germinate and produce a large quantity
of thrifty young plants that later may be taken
up and set where desired, and all without any care
or labor further than the cutting of the tops.</p>

<p>One may begin cutting the asparagus when the
bed is two years old, though small stalks will be
produced at that age. Cutting at this age should
not extend over a period of two weeks and in
an established bed should be limited to four. All
small stalks should be cut and not allowed to grow
during the cutting period as they would exhaust
the plant if allowed to grow, but when the cutting
period is over they should, of course, be allowed
to grow.</p>

<p>Salt was formerly considered essential to successful
asparagus culture and certainly does no
harm, but its chief value is in keeping down weeds
and this can be quite as successfully done by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
hand cultivation; this is better than to form
the habit of depending on some quick, laborless
road to clean beds&mdash;in the annals of gardening
"There ain't no such animule."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="small">EARLY SPRING VEGETABLES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">May</span> be classified under two heads: those
that remain in the ground over winter and
are ready for use as soon as the frost is out of
the ground and those vegetables that, owing to
the short time required to bring to maturity,
are first available from the present year's planting;
among the first may be cited such forms as
asparagus, parsnips, salsify, parsley, kale, onions
and a few others.</p>

<p>The latter class include such vegetables as beets,
lettuce, radishes, endive and early peas, all of
which may be planted as soon as the ground can
be worked in spring, but for very earliest results
use should be made of the hotbed, sowing the
seed in February or March according to the latitude
and transplanting as soon as the ground can
be worked in spring. By doing this from three
to six weeks' time may be gained. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
time that plants from the hotbeds are transplanted
seed may be sown in the open ground
in adjoining rows or as a continuation of a
short row of transplants, to come into use about
the time the first planting is exhausted; in this
way a succession may be maintained and the
ground made to produce a more profitable
amount of vegetables as seed may be sown where
the transplanted vegetables were grown as soon
as they are removed.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">BEETS</p>

<p>Which may be planted in open ground as soon
as it can be worked in spring, do best on a fibrous
loamy soil, but any good, warm, rich loam will
grow them satisfactorily; the cleaner the ground
and the more thorough the cultivation, however,
the more uniform the crop which will be produced.
Sow the seed in drills fifteen to twenty inches
apart and about &frac12; inch deep, covering and
tramping down the rows. It is customary to
sow the seed rather freely when sown by hand,
but if the seed is good rather better results follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
sowing with a seeder, owing to the more even
distribution and the lessened amount of thinning
required; if vegetables of this class did not need
thinning their cultivation would be robbed of
its chief burden; unfortunately they do need it
and quite drastic thinning at that; thinning should
commence as soon as the beets are large enough
to handle, leaving them standing about one inch
apart. In about two weeks another thinning
may be given. By this time the young beets will
be large enough for greens and they may be
thinned to stand two inches apart in the row;
a third thinning will be final and should leave
about four inches between the beets; this will
allow room for full maturity and perfectly
formed roots. Beets are at their best when about
an inch to an inch and a quarter in diameter and
this is the size which is utilized for canning; when
used of this size about an inch of the top may be
left on and they are served whole, dressed with
butter and seasoning.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian beet has long been acknowledged
as standard, but Crosby's Egyptian is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
distinct improvement upon the old form. It is
earlier, the color fine and the quality very sweet
and tender. Early Model beet is a new comer
with an excellent reputation and both are good
selections for the home or the market garden.</p>

<p>In sowing in the hotbed it is not necessary
to cover more than a fourth of an inch; scatter
the seed thinly and transplant in about three
to four weeks from the sowing of the seed, or
when the plants and weather make the successful
planting most assured; set the plants about an
inch to an inch and a quarter apart and in using
remove every other one; this leaves abundant
room for them to develop and makes cultivating
and freedom from weeds more assured.</p>

<p>A light application of nitrate of soda will work
wonders in growing early beets; scatter the nitrate
thinly along the rows and cultivate in, or
the nitrate may be dissolved in water and applied
from a watering can, care being taken to apply
to the soil only and not to the plants. A handful
of nitrate, about the usual quantity applied
to a two-gallon watering-pot of water, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
sufficient, or a hundred pounds to the acre&mdash;this
would amount to about twenty-five pounds
to the ordinary garden.</p>

<p>Beets may be sown for succession up to the
middle of July and will mature a crop for winter
use. Late sown beets are less care to cultivate
owing to the fact that the season's crop of weeds
is by that time pretty well under control.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SWISS CHARD</p>

<p>Has been for several years much exploited by
seedsmen as the one indispensable vegetable for
the city garden. It is no doubt a dependable
source of greens, making a rapid growth of succulent
leaves and is one of the showy, effective
things in the garden that gives an air of abundance
and successful gardening unsurpassed by
any other vegetable, but, in my opinion, its merit
ends right there and if it were not for its value in
furnishing green food in the greatest quantity in
the least time I should not give it space in the garden;
the midrib, so much recommended for cooking
like asparagus, has an unpleasant, earthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
taste that, to me at least, is very disagreeable.</p>

<p>Its culture, however, is so easy that it is worth
while for any one who likes it to grow it. It can
be planted in the open ground as soon as the
ground can be worked in the spring, or sown in
the hotbed and transplanted, thus gaining three
weeks or more; sow in drill, scattering the seed
thinly and thin out the plants to stand six inches
apart in the rows. A light dressing of nitrate
of soda will hasten the growth and render the
leaves more tender and succulent. This plant
does not need to have successive sowings made
as by cutting down to the ground it will make a
new growth, and the outside leaves may be gathered,
the same as is done with spinach, and so
produce a continuous growth of tender, crisp
leaves.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of the chard, the Giant
Lucullus and the Silver Beet; the latter variety
being more delicate in flavor, having less of the
earthy taste. A novel variety&mdash;a cross between
the Swiss Chard and the table beet&mdash;is now offered
by Luther Burbank which combines with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the usual chard qualities, much beauty of foliage,
the leaves being gorgeous in pink, yellow, green
and white and it would certainly add to the joy
of gardening to have so beautiful a thing to tend,
for this reason and because the bunnies must have
food, I am growing it in my garden this year.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CHINESE CABBAGE</p>

<p>Though not a spring vegetable it is so similar
in some respects to Swiss Chard that it may well
be a companion vegetable. It much resembles
the Romaine or Coss lettuce in its lush, upright
leaves. It should not, however, be planted until
about the first of July as early plantings run
quickly to seed and do not develop the fine big
leaves of the type. It may be planted in short
rows and transplanted to about nine inches apart
when large enough to handle. Nitrate is again
indicated for this quick-growing, succulent plant
and as soon as the leaves have attained considerable
size they should be confined by tying with
bast or strips of soft cloth, to prevent their falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
apart rather than to blanch them. The outer
leaves may be gathered as they mature, leaving
the inner leaves to grow and be gathered later.
It is eaten raw or cooked like cabbage, being
more delicate in flavor and without the objectionable
cabbage odor when cooking. The large,
fleshy midribs, stripped off the leaf, may be eaten
raw with salt like celery or cooked like asparagus.
When tied up the plant much resembles a very
large, handsome stalk of celery, but with big,
broad leaves instead of the feathery fronds of the
latter plant.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">ENDIVE</p>

<p>Classes with the foregoing vegetables, requiring
practically the same treatment. It should
be started in the hotbed for early use, transplanting
to the open ground when the weather
is favorable. As it does not make very rapid
growth at first it may as well remain under the
favorable guardianship of the warm hotbed until
the middle of May, when it should be transplanted
in rows, setting the plants six inches or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
more apart. When the plants are about two-thirds
grown they must be drawn together and
tied for blanching, without which they are unfit
to use; this must be done when the plants are
perfectly dry&mdash;in the middle of a bright, sunny
forenoon, being the best time for the work, otherwise
they will rot as they are very sensitive to
moisture and prone to decay&mdash;as a Japanese
friend said of chrysanthemum seed;&mdash;"They are
very corruptible."</p>

<p>They are a most acceptable addition to salads
and combine acceptably with lettuce having a
tangy bitterness very piquant, but it is as a garnish
that they excel; the fringed and curled
fronds, pure white or tinged with green in the
less well-blanched specimens, are beautiful indeed
and they may well be grown for this alone.</p>

<p>Covering with boards is sometimes resorted to
instead of tying, two boards being laid along
either side of the row to form a cap. It takes
about three weeks to properly blanch endive and
the plants should be used as soon as ready. If
desired plants may be taken up in the fall and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
planted in pots or boxes and placed in a light
warm cellar or an upstairs window for winter use.
As the endive makes a mass of fibrous roots it
can be lifted without in any way checking its
growth.</p>

<p>The Giant Fringed Endive is one of the best
kinds. The Self-blanching Endive is not a satisfactory
sort as it lacks the beautiful color of the
blanched sort and is more prone to run to seed;
either sort when running up can be cut and fed
to the rabbits and so turned to good account, in
fact I consider it worth planting for this purpose
alone. The Staghorn Endive is an excellent
sort for spring growing as, started in the hotbed
and transplanted, it does not run to seed&mdash;a fault
most other varieties are addicted to; this sort
may be planted for early salads and the Giant
Fringed later for fall and winter. Like all
plants which depend upon rapid growth for crispness
and flavor an application of nitrate is beneficial
to endive and mellow, rich soil should be
selected for its growth.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">LETTUCE</p>

<p>For the very earliest use plant seed in hotbed
and transplant to open ground about the middle
of May, setting the plants about a foot apart
if head lettuce is desired and, of course, no one
who is acquainted with the superior excellence
of head lettuce over the leaf variety will care to
grow the latter. There are so many excellent
varieties of lettuce on the market that one hesitates
to recommend any special sort but some
are more reliable headers than others. One of
the surest headers and an excellent sort to plant
in summer as it is more resistant of heat than
most sorts, is the Improved Hanson; this variety
makes a large, globe-shaped head, so compact
that the inner leaves are beautifully blanched and
the quality is excellent. For those who like a
brown-leaved lettuce and in my opinion this sort
excels in flavor all others, the old May King is one
of the best and should always find a place in the
garden whatever other varieties are grown. It
is not as large as lettuce and permits of closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
planting than Hanson or All Season&mdash;another
most excellent head lettuce&mdash;a sure header and
slow to run to seed; it makes an immense head&mdash;almost
as large as a Flat Dutch Cabbage, with
beautifully blanched inner leaves and a fine,
buttery flavor.</p>

<p>Of the loose-leaved lettuce the Grand Rapids
Forcing Lettuce is the best known. This is a
good sort to grow in the hotbed and may be
allowed to remain after the other vegetables are
removed, resetting to stand a few inches apart.
The leaves are upright and loose, beautifully
green and curled and the flavor crisp and delicious.
It may be grown to use while the other
sorts are heading.</p>

<p>Romaine or Coss Lettuce is the sort served in
the big hotels as Romaine salad. It requires
transplanting either from the hotbed to the open
ground or from the seed row in the open ground
to another row. It should stand about four
inches apart in the row as the growth is upright,
rather than spreading, and when of sufficient
size the leaves must be tied together to blanch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
It is very crisp and delicious lettuce when quickly
grown by the aid of much fertilizer, good culture
and moisture, but lacking these is rather tough
and bitter. Nitrates may be used to advantage,
applied along the rows after the plants are
transplanted.</p>

<p>All lettuce is at best in spring and early summer.
It is very difficult to grow good lettuce in
hot weather. If a width of cheese cloth is
stretched over the row and the soil kept moist
much better results can be secured. Leaf lettuce
is more easily managed in mid-summer than head
lettuce and unless one can give special attention
this is a better sort to sow for succession.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">ONIONS</p>

<p>Are an all-the-year-round vegetable and belong
to each season according to how they are
handled. For green onions, early in spring, the
White Potato, or Multiplier, Onions are deservedly
popular; these are usually raised from sets
planted in drills where they are to form a permanent
bed and cultivated during summer; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
form a clump of tender shoots which are ready
for use in May. If, however, the bed is neglected
and allowed to form sod or weeds the onions deteriorate
and become tough and woody; their principal
merit consists in their earliness. For first
class bunching onions, however, onions with bottoms,
one should sow seed in August in a fine,
clean seed bed that has been heavily manured,
scattering the seed thinly in drills one foot or fifteen
inches apart and thin the plants to stand
two inches apart in the rows. Onions are quite
hardy and will usually winter without protection
but in severe climates a light covering of straw
or of evergreen boughs will be beneficial; this
practice gives very fine green onions early in
the spring.</p>

<p>Another practice, very satisfactory for the
home garden, consists in planting in early spring
the old onions placed in storage for winter use;
usually these will have begun to grow by March
and are useless for cooking, but if pulled apart
and each shoot planted out in good garden soil
they will start at once into growth and in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
weeks' time produce a delicious green onion,
sweet and of the utmost tenderness. I have found
it a good thing to spade the flower beds intended
for the growing of annuals and bedding plants
early in the season and plant the onions in these,
thus saving room in the garden and getting a
greater use of the flower beds.</p>

<p>Unlike many vegetables the onion can be grown
year after year on the same ground, providing
it is well fertilized each year with barnyard
manure, so that the humus content of the soil is
not depleted. Clean tilth is essential, so that as
little hand work as possible may be required for
onions tops are exceedingly tender and injury
to them checks the growth of the bulbs. The
garden overalls adopted by many women for
working is a distinct advantage in the onion bed.
For onion sets sow seed in drills early in spring;
gather the sets when ripe and store in a dry place
till spring; slight freezing will not injure them
but they must be protected from thawing and
freezing.</p>

<p>But for winter onions of notable size and quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the New Onion Culture should be adopted:&mdash;This
consists in sowing the seed in the hotbed
in early spring and transplanting to the open
ground when the weather is suitable. Set the
tiny plants an inch apart in the rows, thin when
big enough to use as green onions, removing every
other one leaving them standing two inches apart,
thin again to stand four inches apart and grow on
until fall. If seed of Prizetaker or Ailsa Craig
are used onions quite the equal of the fancy
Spanish onions sold in the fruit stores will be
produced. The soil must be more than ordinarily
rich; besides the spring dressing given the garden
before ploughing the space selected for the onions
should have well-rotted manure trenched in at
the rate of a wheelbarrow load to every square
yard: in trenching lay back a spade's depth of
soil across the end of the onion bed; fill this space
with manure, trench a second row, throwing the
soil on top of the manure, fill the fresh trench
with manure and continue till the whole bed has
been worked over. Rake the bed until the surface
is perfectly fine and smooth and sow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
seeds in drills fifteen inches apart or set the plants
as directed.</p>

<p>Onions are occasionally attacked by root lice
which if not at once exterminated will quickly
destroy the plants; the lice work on the roots of
the onion and the first evidence of their presence
is a sickly yellowing of the tops; if an onion is
pulled up and examined the presence of the tiny
white lice will at once be evident: the remedy
is salt and the method of applying is to open a
shallow trench beside the rows and scatter salt
quite plentifully along it, filling in the earth
again; one application will exterminate the lice.
Attacks of root lice are by no means common,
but the fact that they do occur and are very
deadly should make one watchful for the first
sign of discoloration in the tops.</p>

<p>When the onion tops show signs of ripening
they should be broken down; this is sometimes
done by rolling a barrel over them. A light
home-made roller may be easily constructed by
taking a length of nine inch stove pipe, fitting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
piece of wood in each end with a hole through the
center to admit a bar of wood or iron which
should be attached at the ends to a handle adjusted
so as to allow the cylinder to roll; this
being light can be rolled over the bed, leveling
two or more rows at a time according to the
length of the cylinder; it can be quickly constructed
of waste material about the place and
any piece of wood of suitable length&mdash;a couple of
lathes, even, will answer, will do for handles. It is
a good idea when it is found necessary to employ
help in cultivating the garden to have a few little
jobs like this on hand in case rain interferes with
the work; in this way neither the time of the help
nor the money of the employer is wasted and I
have found that it gives far better satisfaction to
the help if there is something of the kind for him
to do so that he need not lose his day's or forenoon's
work. Sharpening tools is another job
that it pays to remember in the odd moments. A
memorandum of things that can be done when it
rains, tacked up in a conspicuous place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
work room, toolhouse or barn is a very useful reminder
and avoids an awkward delay while one
tries to think of something to do.</p>

<p>If possible onions should be dug on a warm,
bright day and allowed to lie on the ground until
dry and clean; they should then be stored in a
dry, airy loft or on a scaffolding. On the hay
in a barn is a good place for onions and they can
be left there until freezing weather, for the shorter
time they are in a warm house the better they
will keep. If the temperature drops suddenly
a little hay can be thrown over them. Slight
freezing does not injure onions, but repeated
freezing and thawing does. An upstairs room
is better for storing than a cellar unless the latter
is unusually dry and not too warm. Onions will,
usually, keep in perfect condition until the middle
of February or the first of March, when they
will begin to grow and should be sorted out, and
the sound ones given a cool, dry place and sold
or used as quickly as possible and the remainder
saved for planting in the open ground.</p>

<p class="in0 bold center p2t">PARSLEY</p>

<p>So universally used for garnishing and for
flavoring soups and salads is of very slow germination
and for that reason is more successfully
grown when started in hotbeds and transplanted
into the open ground in May. The ancients held
that parsley should never be sown as they claimed
that the seed had to make a journey to Hades
and remain six weeks; when sown in the open
ground it seems to bear out that theory, so slow
is its appearance above ground. In the hotbed
it requires about three weeks. England, too, has
its superstition of the parsley, believing like the
ancients, that it should be planted, not sown,
that it must make the long journey to the infernal
regions and return and that there the devil takes
his tithe of it, for proof of which they point to
the fact that a small part only of the seed comes
up. A better explanation would be found, I
think, in the quality of the seed, the home grown
seed coming up quite as well as other seed, the
boughten seed sometimes proving unsatisfactory.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>The Greeks held the plant in great respect.
A crown made of dried and withered leaves was
given to the victors in their games. A crown
together with a bunch of laurel was dedicated
to the god of banquets while all the guests at
these feasts wore crowns of parsley under the
impression that the herb created quiet and promoted
appetite. The Romans also decked themselves
in like manner upon similar occasions because
they believed that the plant had the power
to absorb the fumes of wine and thus prevent
drunkenness.</p>

<p>It was parsley that Hercules selected for the
making of his first garland of victory. Greek
gardens were bordered with parsley and rue,
giving rise to the saying, "Oh, we are only at
the parsley and rue." As these ancients used
the plant in their rejoicing and merrymaking, so,
too, it was brought into use in their funeral decorations.
Sprigs of the herb were strewn over
their dead. According to old folk lore parsley
should be sown on Good Friday.</p>

<p>Parsley is a biennial plant, making a fine clump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of edible leaves the first year which in mild winters
or protected positions survives the winter
and starts into growth the following spring. It
soon, however, runs to seed and is of no further
value except to produce seed. If, however, one
wants a small supply of parsley without the annual
trouble of sowing and transplanting a small
bed of it may be allowed to go to seed and self-sow,
when it becomes, practically, a perennial
but does not attain the fine quality that the
specially grown plant does. A single row
through the garden will furnish parsley for an
entire neighborhood as the older leaves are gathered
as needed and the crown allowed to produce
new leaves; this should be done whether the
leaves are needed or not as the quality of the new
growth will be finer in every way, for leaving the
old leaves to mature checks the growth of the
crown leaves. Nine inches at least should be
allowed between the plants and twelve is better,
though when the tiny plants are first transplanted
it may seem a long and lonely distance between
them, but the plants soon fill up the space.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Very little cultivation is needed between the
plants when once they attain full size; the plants
are so dense and spreading that they effectually
choke out the younger weed growth, but the space
between rows should be kept clean.</p>

<p>Of the varieties to plant, only the fine moss
curled should be selected. The Champion Moss
Curled is a standard sort and one of the best, rich
green in color and so crumpled and curled as to
have the appearance of moss. Nearly all florists
or seedsmen have their own especial brand of
seed and one can select those which promise the
best product. If desired bunches of the parsley
may be lifted in the fall and potted or planted
in window-boxes for winter use. They make
a most attractive plant for the window and a
pot of parsley, one of well-blanched endive and
one of red celestial peppers make a most cheerful
window decoration for the kitchen or dining-room,
as well as furnishing crisp decorative material
for the table.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">PARSNIPS</p>

<p>May be classed among the early spring vegetables
as they are planted as early as the ground
can be worked in spring and are likewise ready
for use as soon as the frost is out of the ground
so that they may be dug; like all root vegetables
they require rich, deeply dug or ploughed land.
Not less than twelve inches in depth is required
for successful cultivation; with shallow cultivation
crooked and many branched roots are produced
which are unsalable and of little value for
home consumption. The long, smooth, beautifully
white roots&mdash;two inches or more at the
crown, are only produced in well-prepared soil.</p>

<p>Parsnips are planted directly in the open
ground as soon as the ground can be worked in
spring, sowing the seed in drills an inch and a
quarter deep, covering and tramping down the
rows if the weather is dry. They should be
thinned to stand from four to six inches apart in
the row that the roots may make perfect development.
The rows should be eighteen inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
apart and the ground kept loose and clean
throughout the growing season.</p>

<p>The usual practice is to let the parsnips remain
in the ground over winter, taking up and
storing in boxes of slightly moist earth or sand,
in the cellar, a supply for winter use. The parsnip
is improved in quality by a touch of frost
but must be dug before growth starts in the
spring.</p>

<p>Parsnips are eaten quite readily by Belgian
hares and imperfect or small roots may be sorted
out and fed to them, avoiding any loss in grading.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">PEAS</p>

<p>Of the very earliest kinds, and that is distinctly
the smooth peas, should be gotten into the ground
very early in spring. Most of the early sorts
will stand considerable cold, but the wrinkled
sorts are tender and should not be planted until
the weather and soil are warm and reasonably dry.
More failures in growing peas come from planting
in cold, wet soil, in a mistaken hurry to get
early peas than from any other cause.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>Ground for peas should be very rich; it is not
sufficient that the garden plot has been well
manured before ploughing;&mdash;the strip allotted
to the growing of peas should have additional
fertilizer trenched in, especially is this necessary
in growing the wrinkled sorts and especially the
dwarf peas, such as Nott's Excelsior and the
like. These dwarf peas cannot bear a big crop
on their abbreviated tops unless forced to production
by heavy feeding, but as the wrinkled,
medium early and mid-season peas are the most
delicious of all in quality, the extra care required
is well repaid. Another object in heavy fertilizing
is that by this means a succession of peas
may be grown on the same ground. Personally
I prefer peas that require support to the very
dwarf sorts; in the first place you have more vine
for the production of pods. You cannot, with
the best intentions, get as big a crop from one
foot of vine as you can from three, all things
being equal. Again, the labor of gathering pods
from upright growing vines where the pods are
easily seen and reached is far less than from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
prostrate vines which must be lifted or looked
under in search of pods. Wire netting furnishes
a better support than brush and where the gardener
is a woman is much pleasanter to work
about. Brush has an unpleasant habit of catching
on the clothing and twisting around, often
to the injury of the vine, but the netting gives a
firm support, to which the vine readily attaches
itself.</p>

<p>In the home garden the best way to plant
peas is in double rows a foot apart, making the
trench about three inches deep and dropping the
peas as evenly as possible. Early sown peas
do not require as deep planting as the wrinkled
sorts which may be planted four or five inches
deep to avoid blight. As the wrinkled sorts are
very tender they should not go into the ground
before corn planting time and not then unless
the nights and soil are warm.</p>

<p>An excellent arrangement for a succession of
peas in the home garden is to prepare the rows
by trenching in manure and then make two furrows
a foot apart and in one furrow plant the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
earliest peas and in the other a second early pea,
stretching a four or five foot width of wire netting
between the rows; this extends the bearing
season a couple of weeks. When all the pods
have formed on the earliest varieties of vines a
second furrow may be opened beside it and a
wrinkled sort of medium earliness be planted;
these will be ready to climb about the time the
first vines are turning yellow when they may be
pulled up, leaving their place for the new vines.
This system of succession of planting may be
repeated on the other side of the netting, thus
giving four sowings of peas to one strip of netting
and a succession of peas for several weeks.</p>

<p>The germination of the seed may be hastened
by soaking the seed over night in warm water
and when sowing unsoaked seed, in dry weather,
germination is hastened by pouring hot water into
the trench before covering the seed.</p>

<p>The experienced gardener will have his pet
variety of peas but the amateur will be somewhat
afield in selection so I would suggest as a desirable
early sort the Gradus or Prosperity Pea, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
delicious sort of the tall kind that has much to
recommend it. American Wonder is another
extra early pea of a wrinkled sort that appeals to
those who prefer a dwarf pea, being but a foot
in height and compares in general excellence with
Nott's Excelsior. On the same trellis with
Gradus may be planted the Senator Pea; this
is a number one pea in every respect&mdash;quality,
quantity and appearance; following these one
may plant more Senators and the Telephone;
these will give a succession of peas for several
weeks.</p>

<p>So many enemies conspire against the pea
that close watch must be kept from the planting
of the seed until the plants are well above the
ground. Usually the chief depredation comes
from moles which run along underneath the seed
and destroy it; poisoned bait placed in the
trench along with the seed often destroys the
moles before much damage is done. A mole trap
set at each end of the row or at the point where
the mole enters the run will often prove effective.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
A very successful home made trap consists of a
large can or crock&mdash;a lard can is good, sunk in
the ground and a trap consisting of a long, endless
box with about a third of the bottom sawed
apart and pivoted on nails driven through the
side, so that anything entering at one end will
drop through the swinging trap into the can beneath,
which should be kept full of water; this
arrangement will catch more moles than any steel
trap with which I am familiar, and as the presence
of the moles in the garden threatens other
vegetables as well as the peas it will be time well
spent to prepare one or more of these traps for
use when occasion arises; the making of these
traps may well be put on the list of rainy day
tasks.</p>

<p>Cutworms sometimes take the peas as fast
as they appear above the ground; poisoned bait
along the rows before the peas break the ground
will dispose of this enemy. Blackbirds often
destroy a planting of peas before their presence
is suspected and English sparrows have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
known to do much damage, so if one would enjoy
fresh, home grown peas one must exercise
due vigilance.</p>

<p>The use of Mulford and other cultures for
inoculating peas is growing in practice among
the most progressive gardeners and is a very
wise precaution to take; especially is it desirable
in intensive culture suggested by growing
two crops of peas on the same strip of land.
Peas, like all legumes, are nitrogen feeders and
gatherers and the use of the culture supplies the
young plant, at the start, with nitrogen and puts
it in shape to begin the accumulation of nitrogen
from the air by its own efforts. The nitrogen
gathered from the air is stored up on the roots
in the form of nodules or bunches, and it is for
this reason that the growing of all legumes is so
beneficial to the soil. If when the first planting
of peas is matured and gathered the vines are cut
or broken off close to the ground, instead of being
pulled up, root and all, this supply of nitrogen
will remain in the soil and be available for the
succeeding crop.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>The inoculating of the seed is very simple:
the small bottles, which, by the way, cost but
twenty-five cents for garden size, are only one-fourth
full; simply fill up the bottle with water
and moisten the seed before planting; this is all,
and the same bottle will supply inoculating material
for the beans which also being legumes respond
favorably to the treatment.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">RADISHES</p>

<p>A few radishes may be grown in the hotbed
for very early use, but the main planting should
be in the open ground. It is hardly worth while
to devote any definite part of the garden to radishes
as room can be found for them among the
other vegetables. An excellent way to grow
them is to drop seeds at intervals along the rows
of beets, carrots, parsnips and salsify. All these
seeds are slow in germinating and by dropping
in occasional radish seeds which germinate in
from three to five days the rows will be marked
so that they may be kept cultivated without waiting
for the plants to appear and indicate the rows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
A surprising amount of radishes will be grown
in this way, without any special labor and loss
of ground; and they will be out of the way before
the ground is needed for the permanent occupant
of the row.</p>

<p>The turnip rooted sorts are the most quickly
and easily grown, the Twenty Day as its name
indicates being ready for use in twenty days and
the French Breakfast and Improved Breakfast
Radish being ready in twenty-five; both of these
are very tender, crisp and mild sorts and beautiful
in appearance, white at the base and scarlet
above, making a beautiful appearance when prepared
for the breakfast table with a bit of the
green top for contrast. For those who prefer a
white radish the Icicle Radish is a fine sort, crisp
and tender and does not grow coarse or pithy
until quite large.</p>

<p>If one wishes to devote a definite space to radishes
and maintain a succession of plants it will
be a good plan to drop a seed in the ground for
each radish pulled; in this way there will be a constant
supply of young, crisp radishes all summer.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>Where only a few are desired it is a good plan
to plant a short space of the rows devoted to other
vegetables to radishes and lettuce and perhaps
a few plants of endive and parsley next to the
path and near the house so that they may be
easily got at without walking on the newly cultivated
ground.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SALSIFY</p>

<p>Is another plant that is started very early in
the spring and eaten as soon as the frost is out
of the ground. It is one of the most useful and
delicious of this class of plants and is not nearly
as much cultivated as it should be. Sliced and
cooked tender it makes, when combined with
milk, seasoning and cracker crumbs, a most acceptable
substitute for oyster soup or, cooked,
mashed and mixed with a little flour and seasoning
and butter, dipped in egg and bread crumbs,
it makes delicious little cakes when fried. Its
culture is simple, any good, light fertile soil producing
a good crop, but to produce clean, smooth
roots it should be deeply dug and well cultivated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Sow the seed in shallow drills early in the season;
thin to stand six inches apart in the row. It is
hardy and may remain in the ground all winter,
but a supply for winter use should be dug at the
approach of cold weather and stored in boxes of
sand or earth in the root cellar. As soon as the
frost is out of the ground in spring and before
growth starts they must be dug. If it is desired
to grow seed the plants should be set out again, or
may be left where they are if the ground is not
needed for other vegetables, and cultivated the
same as seedling plants.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SPINACH</p>

<p>The most important of the vegetables grown
for greens, should be sown in the open ground
as early as the ground can be worked if wanted
for early spring and summer use. For fall and
winter use sow in September. For a succession
sow every two weeks. Sow in drills one foot
apart and one inch deep, in soil as fertile as one
can compass; the soil cannot be too rich for spinach,
as upon the rapidity of its growth depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
the tenderness and succulence of its leaves; in
poor soil, especially if allowed to suffer for water,
the leaves will be tough and ill-flavored. Light
applications of nitrate of soda have a magic effect
on spinach and should be applied lightly every
two weeks.</p>

<p>The Round Seeded Savoy is a standard sort,
with thick, fleshy leaves, curled and crinkled; the
New Zealand is a good sort for summer as it withstands
heat well and is slow to run to seed. In
gathering the spinach the entire top may be cut
off a bit above the crown; this induces a new,
quick, tender growth of leaves.</p>

<p>In planting for spring and winter use the beds
should be covered with straw at the approach of
cold weather. Spinach often self-sows and gives
a volunteer crop the following spring. When
the spinach begins to send up seed stalks it may
be cut and fed to the rabbits and so waste that
would otherwise ensue may be avoided.</p>

<p class="in0 bold center p2t">BEANS</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Being</span> somewhat tender, should not be
planted until the ground is warm in spring.
Corn-planting time will do for the field and
navy bean, but the white podded string bean and
the lima bean should not go into the ground
until all danger of frost is past and the ground
is in growing condition. At the present advanced
cost of seed&mdash;fifty-five cents a pound for
the string and lima sorts with postage added by
some dealers, it will not do to take any chances
by being in too much of a hurry to get seed into
the ground; neither will it pay to buy seed of any
but reliable dealers. There has never been a
time when so much importance attaches to choosing
one's seed merchant wisely. Cheap seed
never pays, for the time lost in replanting seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
of poor germination, or, worse still, that comes
untrue to name, giving one inferior or mongrel
vegetables, offsets, many times, the amount saved
in money.</p>

<p>String beans are the first form in which this
favorite vegetable appears on the table and a
very delicious and attractive dish they make when
such white wax or golden wax as Wardwell's
Kidney, Davis's Kidney Wax, Improved Golden
Wax are selected; well grown plants of these
varieties, well laden with their long, wax-like
pods are a joy to the gardener; and if the pods
are gathered as fast as they mature, and this may
be done as soon as they whiten, up to the time they
are fully grown, when they will still be sweet and
tender, the bushes will continue to bear heavily
until cut down by the frost; this should always be
done whether the beans are wanted for use or not;
they can be canned, sold, or given away or fed to
the pig&mdash;anything rather than to check the vines'
bearing. If one wishes to save seed for the next
year's planting, and this is worth while when
such high prices prevail, it will be well to set aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
a row, or portion of a row, for seed, allowing the
first pods to ripen as this establishes the early
bearing characteristic of the plant.</p>

<p>In planting beans good soil should be chosen,
but beans do not need rich soil as many other
garden vegetables do. It is said that beans will
grow on soil that will not grow anything else;
this is rather an extreme statement, but it is
a fact that they will thrive where more exacting
plants will languish; this is accounted for by the
fact that the bean is a legume and so empowered
to draw an important part of its nourishment
from the air in the form of nitrates, which it stores
in little pockets or nodules on its roots and so
has a larder of its own to draw on.</p>

<p>Open a drill a couple of inches deep and drop
the beans at regular intervals two or three inches
apart, or they may be planted three or four in
hills, six inches apart; cover and tramp down the
rows and draw the rake lightly over them. Except
for the distance at which they are planted,
all beans require practically the same treatment;
they should never be cultivated when wet or gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
or handled in any way; the rule should be to
give them a wide berth in wet weather; working
among them when wet is the cause of the disfiguring
rust that makes them unsalable and in
bad cases uneatable. Wardwell's and Davis's
Kidney Wax are as free from rust as any of the
white podded varieties and are the best selections
the amateur gardener can make.</p>

<p>For those who like a green podded bean the
Stringless Green Pod is a fine variety and
very popular with gardeners. Giant Stringless,
Green Pod and Longfellow make up a trio of
beans hard to beat.</p>

<p>Boston pea bean or navy bean is the best
selection for baked beans; these should be allowed
to ripen their pods until quite dry. The usual
method of harvesting is to wait until all the beans
are ripe in late summer and harvest by pulling
the vines and piling in heaps until dry; this is
not an economical way, however, nor specially
adapted to the small home garden; a better way
is to gather the pods as fast as they ripen, storing
them in a dry, airy place until ready to shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
easily; if this is done many more beans will be
produced and there will be no loss from the
earlier beans shelling out on the ground as they
will when the vines are left for the entire crop
to ripen. Usually it will be necessary to go over
the vines about four times but the result will be
a much greater quantity of beans and all in the
finest possible condition; when left until all are
ripe it will be found that there is a considerable
amount of mouldy or injured beans.</p>

<p>Lima beans require somewhat different treatment
from the string or navy bean; to begin
with they require a much richer soil and the
ground should be well manured and a supplementary
dressing of hen manure, rabbit droppings
or ashes about the plants when well established
will be of much benefit; they require more
room in the row than the string beans, not less
than eight or nine inches with the rows two feet
apart; the beans should be planted about two
inches deep, setting the seed with the eyes downward
and covering and tramping the rows.
Rather late planting is advisable for limas than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
for string beans and for very early beans a few
may be started in the hotbed and transplanted
in the open ground about the twentieth of May
at the north&mdash;add or subtract a week for each hundred
miles north or south. The bean, having no
tap root and a broad spread of lateral roots, is
one of the easiest plants to transplant and by
starting a hundred plants in the hotbed a much
earlier crop will be obtained; that will be filling
up the time while the open air planting is coming
forward.</p>

<p>Another very important advantage in starting
seed in the hotbed is the larger per cent. of plants
obtained; if good seed is used every one may be
depended upon to grow. The hotbed also affords
protection from the enemies that destroy
the lima, one of the most destructive being hens,
and it will be wise to assure Biddy's absence from
the garden until the beans are showing their first
leaves as the succulent looking white seeds that
first break through the ground have an irresistible
attraction for her and she will walk along
the rows, nipping off every pod as it appears;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
this seems to be due to curiosity as she does not
eat, but drops them on the ground; I have seen
whole plantings of lima beans destroyed in this
way. English sparrows also are known to destroy
the tops. String beans do not offer the
temptation that the limas do so are seldom molested.</p>

<p>For the home garden the bush limas are to be
preferred as they take less room and are easier
to handle. The Improved Fordhook Bush Lima
is one of the best varieties if not the best. The
New Wonder Bush Lima is highly recommended.
Beans may be planted every two weeks for succession
up to August. Dry limas that remain on
the vines in fall may be used for cooking in winter.
Limas are not injured by light frosts as
much as the other varieties of beans; the pods
cuddling under the thick foliage are protected
and one can frequently gather a mess after the
frost has cut everything else in the garden; the
thick pods, too, are a protection to the beans inside.</p>

<p>If it is desired to grow pole limas set the poles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
four feet apart each way and plant five or six
beans to each hill and thin to three when the
plants are up; when the plants have reached the
top of the pole pinch out the top; add a spadeful
of well-rotted manure to each hill before planting,
mixing it thoroughly with the soil. Carpenteria is
about the best of the pole limas and Early Leviathan
Lima is another good sort. Wire netting
may be used in place of poles and will be found
more convenient and economical. Treating the
beans with farmogerm, Mulford or other culture
is advisable.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CABBAGE</p>

<p>For early cabbage sow seed in the hotbed or
in flats in the house and transplant to the open
ground in May. Cabbage are not injured by
light frosts and can go into the ground earlier
than most other garden stuff; usually the early
sorts are selected for first planting but the late
and winter sorts will, if started in heat, do about
as well as the early; it is largely a matter of
handling. The Late Flat Dutch is an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
sort for the first planting as it is a very sure
header, giving large, flat heads of the best quality.
In twelve years' experience in growing this
variety I have never found a diseased plant nor,
except in a year of very exceptional weather, a
soft head. They keep well over winter and are
altogether a very satisfactory all round cabbage.</p>

<p>In transplanting the plants from the hotbed to
the open ground all but the upper pair of leaves
should be removed and these may have the upper
half clipped; this gives the roots a chance to establish
themselves before they are called upon to
support top growth. Set the plants about two
feet apart each way, or the rows two feet apart
and the plants twenty inches; the nearer distance
is tenable if one raises rabbits as the lower
leaves may be removed and fed to them, thus
giving the plants more room; they should close
up the gaps between them when fully grown as
this shades the ground and conserves moisture&mdash;an
important feature in a dry season. The
ground should be kept well cultivated and free
from weeds as long as work can be carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
among them and when the cultivator can no
longer be used the scuffle-hoe can be introduced
under and between them without injury to the
leaves. In hoeing or cultivating draw the earth
up towards the plants.</p>

<p>When the heads are filled out and hard and
it is not desired to gather them they may be kept
from splitting by pulling the roots loose on one
side and bending them over.</p>

<p>The principal enemy of the cabbage is the
white butterfly and its offspring&mdash;the green caterpillar.
There are many ways of combating this
pest; the most effectual way, early in the season
is dusting with Paris green mixed with flour.
A convenient way to apply is to take a quart
Mason jar, take the lid, remove the porcelain
lining and punch the top full of holes, fill the
can with flour mixed with one teaspoon of fresh
Paris green and sift over the plants while wet
with dew at the first appearance of the pest;
this should not be used after the heads have
formed; after this sprinkling with salt and working
it in between the loose leaves of the head is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
often effectual. Dusting with dry earth sometimes
has a deterrent effect on the worms.</p>

<p>The grey aphis is another most troublesome
pest; this comes so insidiously that the plants
are well infested before their presence is suspected.
Spraying with kerosene emulsion is
sometimes effectual if the heads are not too far
advanced. Spraying with zenoleum&mdash;a tablespoonful
to two quarts of water&mdash;will kill every
louse it touches and by its odor discourage any intending
arrivals, but this should not be used where
the heads are at all advanced, though a hard rain
would rid the plants of the odor of both zenoleum
and kerosene. Soapsuds, especially whale oil
and nicotine, are suggested and hand picking of
worms is not without its value. Spraying with
hot water 140&deg; is effectual and safe and cleanses
and stimulates the plants.</p>

<p>Cut worms are very destructive to cabbage
when first set out; their depredations may be
guarded against by enclosing the stem of the
plant in a band of stiff paper when planting; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
should go into the ground an inch and extend up
the stem two or three inches. Strewing poisoned
bait along the intended rows for a night or two is
suggested but this is a dangerous practice where
there is poultry at liberty; baiting after the plants
are set is often successful, too, but the best safeguard
is to have a good supply of surplus plants
in the hotbed. The rows should be looked over
the first thing in the morning after planting to
discover what plants have been cut and wherever
a plant is missing the worm should be looked for,
and when found killed; this is really the most
satisfactory way of eradicating the pest. The
worm never goes more than two or three inches
from the plant and will be found somewhere just
below the surface of the ground, usually under
some bit of roughage that makes a little hollow.
If there is a piece of sod or clover-land near the
garden the cut worms will usually begin their
work from that side and if a planting of cabbage
is made a few days in advance of other plants
this will serve as a trap for the worms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
hunting and killing them for a few days will
make the planting safe for the tomatoes, eggplants,
and peppers.</p>

<p>A little nitrate of soda sprinkled around the
plants is a great incentive to growth.</p>

<p>For winter cabbage sow seed in the open
ground in May and transplant into permanent
rows as soon as large enough, giving the plants
more room than early cabbage. Late Flat
Dutch, Wakefield, Danish Roundhead and Dutch
Winter or Hollander are all good sorts which
will prove good keepers and sellers.</p>

<p>If in setting out plants of winter cabbage it
is found that there are more plants than are
needed, they may be allowed to remain where
they are and given a little protection, such as
boards, cornstalks or evergreens, and can be used
for setting out the following spring.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CAULIFLOWER</p>

<p>Require the same general treatment as cabbage.
They are set somewhat closer in the rows and cultivated
the same as cabbage; however, for the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
results it is desirable to transplant the cauliflower
from the hotbed into cold frames as soon as they
have their second pair of leaves, setting three
inches apart each way and as soon as they resume
growth giving a light application of nitrate of
soda, then transplant when the weather is favorable.
Cauliflower are quite hardy and not injured
by early fall frosts, making steady growth
until severe cold weather and many heads that
have failed to fill during the fall will fill out finely
in November.</p>

<p>As soon as the curd, or head, forms and has
made a little size the leaves must be drawn over
it and tied to exclude rain and light; this
must be done when the plants are perfectly dry
and the weather clear, a sunny day about noon
is the best time for the work. If tied up when
wet or damp the heads will rot. If not tied up
growth will start in the heads, they will turn
purple and green and be unfit for food. It is
upon the successful tying up of the cauliflower
that its successful culture depends; like the cabbage
it requires a rich, well fertilized soil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
applications of nitrate of soda once a week during
the growing season will hasten the development
of the head; wood ashes, too, are beneficial.</p>

<p>The insect enemies of the cauliflower are those
of the cabbage, but they molest it in a somewhat
lesser degree. The remedies to be employed are
the same.</p>

<p>There are two important varieties of cauliflower&mdash;the
Snowball and the Dry Weather.
The former is a poor cropper in dry seasons unless
artificial irrigation can be supplied. The
Dry Weather Cauliflower, on the other hand,
seems to be at its best in a dry season and will
give fine heads when the other fails. As one
can not forecast what the rainfall of any given
season will be it is well to be provided against
any contingency by planting both varieties of
cauliflower; by this forethought one will be assured
of a crop whatever the weather and the
snowballs that failed to head during August and
September may come on in October and November
and give a late crop for pickling.</p>

<p>In the majority of gardens cauliflowers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
grown exclusively for pickling; this is a mistake
for there is no vegetable more delicate and toothsome
than this; it outclasses cabbage and when
fried in batter or breaded with egg and cracker
crumbs, it affords a most excellent substitute for
meat, indeed, it is really more acceptable when
no meat dish accompanies it; for this reason&mdash;its
desirability as a table vegetable&mdash;special pains
should be taken to produce early heads, by starting
in hotbeds, transplanting into cold frames,
fertilizing with nitrate and giving special attention
to thorough cultivation throughout its growing
period. If water can be supplied, a thorough
drenching of the roots once or twice a week,
followed by a cultivation the following morning
to restore the dust-mulch, will be of much benefit.</p>

<p>The green cabbage worm is sometimes very
troublesome on the heads and leaves of cauliflowers
and one should watch for the presence of
the white cabbage butterfly as this will indicate
whether one may expect an attack of caterpillars.
If once the worms have become established spraying
with hot water of from 130&deg; to 140&deg; will exterminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
all with which it comes in contact, as
worms are far more sensitive to hot water than
are the plants which they infect.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CORN</p>

<p>Is one of the most profitable of the garden's
offerings; there is, practically, no loss connected
with it; a delicious vegetable for the table in its
green state, fresh from the stalk; it is equally welcome
when it appears sweet and toothsome from
the can in winter or, conserved in a dried state,
is soaked and cooked the same as fresh corn.
There is no waste in the unused corn that remains
ungathered on the stalks for it may be saved for
seed another year or fed to the poultry, while
the stalks, cut and cured, make excellent feed
for cow, horse or rabbits. Cut while green and
made into ensilage it is the best substitute for
green feed in winter for any animal that eats
green food. Much green feed for stock may be
secured from the corn patch in summer by removing
all the side shoots that do not bear ears
and feeding them to the pigs or rabbits. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
is of benefit to the corn as it allows all the
strength of the plant to go into the ears instead
of being wasted in growing useless foliage.</p>

<p>Corn is a gross feeder and requires a deep,
mellow, fertile soil, well enriched with barnyard
manure. Clover sod well manured and ploughed
will give the maximum amount of corn, but any
good soil if fertilized will produce good corn.</p>

<p>Corn is somewhat tender and should not be
planted until the ground is warm, but in the small
home garden where a small amount of seed is required
a little risk may be run by planting early
in May and replanting if an early frost catches
the crop. It is not, as a general thing, the
spring frost that does the most damage, especially
with field corn, it is the late frost that catches
the corn still in the milk that does the damage,
so that anything that pushes the crop along to
maturity before danger of fall frost is of moment.
This is one reason why heavy fertilizing is so
important,&mdash;it speeds up the maturing of the
corn and gets it beyond the danger line in time.</p>

<p>Sweet corn may be planted in drills or in hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
but I prefer the hill method. Even in a small
patch that can be worked but one way with a
horse or cultivator&mdash;there is always a hoe to take
care of the space between the hills.</p>

<p>The rows should be three feet apart and the
corn in hills three feet apart, or if planted in rows
make the rows four feet apart and the corn
twelve inches apart. Drop several kernels in
each hill and thin to three plants to a hill when
the corn is up and danger of frost is passed. One
pound of seed will plant a hundred hills or from
one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet of
row. If hard frost threatens just as the corn
is coming through the ground, throwing earth
over it with a hoe will often afford sufficient protection
to save it.</p>

<p>In a small garden patch it is not much work
to stick a mark of some kind in the center of each
hill and if this is done cultivation can commence
at once and a hard crust be prevented from forming;
this will hasten the germination of the seed
and insure the elimination of weeds at the start.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of sweet corn advertised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
each seedsman having his own favorite
specialty, but there are really but two that one
need take into consideration&mdash;the old, reliable
Stowell's Evergreen and the new Bantam Evergreen&mdash;a
cross between that exceptionally sweet
corn, the Golden Bantam, and Stowell's Evergreen,
and combining the great qualities of both
parents, the delicious sweetness and tenderness
and earliness of Bantam with the more generous
size and more tender skin of the Evergreen.
Plant these two varieties and have the best to be
obtained in sweet corn. One planting of Evergreen
will give big generous ears of late corn,
while for succession the Bantam may be planted
every two weeks up to July.</p>

<p>When the corn is a couple of feet high it will
be well to go through the patch and remove
all suckers or barren stalks so as to conserve all
the food and moisture for the production of ears.</p>

<p>In addition to barnyard manure, wood ashes is
an important fertilizer for corn, supplying the
potash so essential to its growth; this may be put
in the hill at the time the corn is planted or may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
be scattered about the plants after they are up
and hoed into the soil; it should not be applied
in connection with manure as it has a tendency
to release the ammonia content of the manure, but
should be applied independently. Droppings
from the poultry house may be used in the growing
of the corn crop, placing about a teacupful in
a hill, but not in contact with the seed. Several
barrels of dry droppings should be saved during
the winter for just this extra fertilizing in the
kitchen garden.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>Corn is very easily transplanted so that where
there is a failure of the corn to germinate in some
hills and an over supply in others, the extra plants
may be lifted carefully with the spade or trowel
and slipped into holes prepared for them where
wanted. Last season I had an interesting experience
transplanting an entire row of corn,
over a foot high. A row of okra had been
planted across the garden but failed to appear
on schedule time and was finally given up
and corn planted in its place; the corn came
up and had made several inches of top when
to my surprise the okra appeared. It was evident
that the two robust plants could not occupy
successfully the same ground and I did not wish
to sacrifice either, so an equal number of hills
were prepared in another part of the garden, fertilized
with poultry droppings and ashes and
the hills of corn, then over a foot high, lifted,
one hill at a time, on a spade and carried and
slipped into their holes, and not a plant seemed
aware that anything had happened to it; certainly
there was no check to the growth, but, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
lifting on the spade with plenty of soil adhering,
the roots were not disturbed in the least.</p>

<p>Corn has so few enemies that it is scarcely
worth while to consider them, the principal one
being earworm&mdash;a small worm that eats out the
tip of the ear; they can be poisoned by dropping
Paris green in the axils of the leaves when the
plants are young.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CUCUMBERS</p>

<p>For slicing for the table should be planted as
soon as the ground is warm or a few seed may be
planted on pieces of inverted sod, or in pots or
paper bands in the hotbed and transplanted into
the open ground about corn-planting time or
when the danger of frost is past; this will give
several weeks' start on outdoor planting and will
also make the plants practically immune from
attacks of the striped beetle. Beetles will of
course appear, but by the time of their arrival the
plants will have attained sufficient size to withstand
their attacks, particularly will this be the
case if protected with dry earth, sifted over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
leaves to roughen them or the application of tobacco
tea or tobacco stems or leaves about the
plants.</p>

<p>Pieces of sod, about four inches square, should
be cut and placed earth-side up close together
in the warmest part of the hotbed and several
seeds planted on each piece and the whole
covered with a fourth of an inch of earth. When
ready to transplant lift the pieces on to a flat
board or carrier and slip into a hole prepared for
them with as little disturbance as possible and
press the soil firmly about them so that the air
will not get underneath and dry the roots.</p>

<p>There is not too much room for vine vegetables
of any sort in the small kitchen garden and if desired
the early cucumbers for table use may be
grown on netting. The Japanese cucumber is
a climbing sort especially addicted to this manner
of growth, bears fine, large fruit of most excellent
quality and the position on the wire, away from
the soil and damp ground, produces a most attractive
fruit, free from the yellow blanching
that is present on the cucumbers grown on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
ground. Last year among a number of these
Japanese plants there occurred one or two plants
of a snow white cucumber that I found very
superior in crispness and flavor to the green
fruit. Owing to early frost I was not able to
secure seed of this interloper. Mr. Burbank's
cucumber seed did not produce a single white
seed. This is not, however, a climbing sort, but
all vines which have tendrils can be grown on netting.
Squash even will grow, bear and seem to
enjoy the experience.</p>

<p>Cucumbers when grown for the table should be
gathered as soon as of slicing size, whether wanted
or not, as allowing the fruit to ripen on the vine
stops production; this is especially imperative in
the case of pickles which must be removed as soon
as of sufficient size to use. The small pickles of
an inch and a quarter or less should be gathered
first and larger pickles left until the latter part
of the season as gathering the cucumbers while
very small increases the vine's productiveness
and there will always be enough overlooked to
supply the larger sort of pickles.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>Cucumbers for pickling should not be sown
before June and may be planted at any time after
that up to mid-July. Plant in hills from four to
six feet apart spading in a spadeful of manure in
each hill; thin out to three or four plants in a hill
when danger of bugs is past; spray with Bordeaux
Arsenate of Lead three ounces to a gallon
of water, when in danger of beetles or blight; the
combination of lead and Bordeaux mixture covers
both emergencies.</p>

<p>Keep the ground well cultivated as long as the
vines will allow; pinch off the ends of all the
vines when about a foot long to induce branching;
when the plants begin to bloom notice the presence
or absence of bees. Some years the curcubita
family fails signally in setting fruit and
this is usually caused by lack of pollenization by
the bees. On a small patch one may substitute
cross-pollenization by carrying pollen from one
blossom to another with a camel's hair brush or
by shaking the blossoms against each other, but
a preventative measure would be to raise a colony
or two of bees. Sometimes the presence of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
plant especially attractive to bees will lure them
away from the melons, cucumbers and like plants.
Two years ago the presence of a patch of vetch
proved so attractive to the bees that it was not
until late in the season that the flowers of a nearby
patch of winter squash and citron received
sufficient attention to set any fruit. The air was
resonant with the hum of bees, but not one was
to be seen on the vines.</p>

<p>There are any number of good cucumbers
to choose from for general crop. Early Fortune
has proved a favorite in my garden. It is a good
bearer and quality and appearance are all that
could be asked. The Davis Perfect, Arlington
White Spine, and Westerfield's Chicago Pickle
are all satisfactory sorts to grow.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">EGGPLANTS</p>

<p>Are very tender when small, so they should be
started in the warmest part of the hotbed, or in
a warm, sunny window in flats. When they
have grown their first pair of true leaves they
should be transplanted&mdash;if at all crowded, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
other flats or other rows in the hotbed, setting
them two inches apart each way and grown on,
given sufficient water and occasional cultivation,
but not sufficient to disturb the roots, until time
to plant out in the open ground; this should not
be done until the nights and soil are warm as a
check at this time will mean a late setting of
fruit.</p>

<p>Eggplants are considered one of the difficult
things to grow; personally I have seldom lost a
plant except at the hands, or mouth rather, of cutworms,
but I have frequently gotten an unsatisfactory
setting of fruit. However, one must
have certain standards to adhere to in their culture,
the first of which is heat in all the early
stages of their growth, the second, rich soil, with
occasional supplementary dressings of nitrate of
soda, and thorough cultivation.</p>

<p>The plants require considerable room when
mature and should not be set closer than three feet
each way.</p>

<p>The principal enemy of the eggplant is the
potato beetle which is quite as partial to egg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
plants as to potatoes. Spraying with Paris green
or arsenate of lead is effectual before the fruit
has formed but hand picking is more satisfactory
and where only a few plants are grown for family
use, quite as practical. It is not the mature
beetle that eats the leaves but the young beetles
that hatch from the mass of yellow eggs laid on
the under side of the leaves, so at the first appearance
of the old bugs search should be made
for the mass of eggs and these as well as the
parent beetle destroyed; by this means no beetles
can get a start. It is always good practice to
avoid, as far as possible, the use of poisonous insecticides
in the kitchen garden; while their use
may do no harm on vegetables that have not set
their fruit, there is always a tendency to grow
careless in their use and to continue it after the
safety zone has been passed.</p>

<p>New York eggplant is the standard variety
for all but the northern states; it is of the highest
type, spineless and of a rich, purple color, large
and borne in abundance; it is not as early as Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Beauty, long a favorably known sort, which is
about twelve days earlier; Very Early Dwarf
Purple is still earlier and Black Pekin is another
good sort. In the northern states the earliest
variety should be planted, but the eggplant has
one remarkable characteristic&mdash;for a plant so tender
in its early stages it seems, when fully grown,
almost immune to cold and early frost, and I
have often gathered unharmed fruit after severe
frost had cut most everything else in the garden.
Throwing some loose stuff&mdash;clover hay, corn fodder
or weeds&mdash;over the plants on a cold night will
usually save them and a spell of warm weather
that usually follows the first hard frosts may
bring on immature fruit to a usable size. It requires
about five months from the sowing of the
seed to produce usable fruit so it will readily be
seen that it is important to start the seed in the
hotbed, greenhouse or in the house and to take
every precaution to grow them on rapidly without
any check.</p>

<p class="in0 bold center p2t">OKRA</p>

<p>So well and favorably known in the southern
states, is practically unknown in the north, except
as its acquaintance is made in the chicken
gumbo of the commercial soups and a few other
vegetable and meat preparations. It should,
however, form a staple vegetable of the kitchen
garden and, once its merits are known, would,
doubtless, become as popular north as it is south.
Though its use is chiefly associated with the preparation
of soup it has other, equally acceptable,
uses. It is an excellent addition to hash, adding
both richness and flavor; added to tomatoes it imparts
a fuller, richer flavor and used alone, fried,
is excellent. A small amount of meat, with the
addition of potatoes, okra and onion, the last two
fried tender before adding the meat and potatoes,
makes a most satisfying one-dish meal.</p>

<p>It is one of the easiest vegetables to grow, requiring
the same culture as corn; making the rows
three feet apart, and planting the seed in drills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and thinning to ten inches apart in the row.
Perkin's Long Pod is the best general variety
and the pods should be gathered when half grown,
whether needed or not, to prevent checking the
production.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">PEPPERS</p>

<p>Like the eggplant require much heat in starting
and should be given the warmest position
in the hotbed&mdash;about the central sash, towards
the front&mdash;so that they may not be overtopped
by other, taller growing plants, for the pepper
grows but slowly for the first few weeks of its
existence.</p>

<p>The seed germinates slowly, taking from two
to three weeks to appear; it may be sown thinly
in drills, or broadcasted, covering sufficiently to
conceal the seed and placing paper over the plot
to prevent drying out. If started in flats in the
house the plants may be transplanted into other
flats when they have made one pair of true leaves;
if not crowded in the hotbed they may be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
to remain where they are or be transplanted
into fresh rows, setting them a couple of inches
apart each way.</p>

<p>They should not be planted out in the open
ground until the soil and nights are warm as a
check at this time will mean late fruiting and
failure to ripen. Make the rows from twenty-four
to thirty inches apart and set the plants
eighteen inches apart in the row. Before planting
spade a forkful of old manure or henhouse
droppings into each hill for the pepper is a heavy
feeder and requires good soil.</p>

<p>Protect the plants on cold nights if frost threatens
and keep the ground well cultivated.</p>

<p>If the peppers are to be grown in the north
such varieties as mature their fruits early should
be selected. Crimson Giant is about the earliest;
the plants are large and bear abundantly. The
Upright New Sweet Pepper is also early, a good
bearer and its habit of fruiting&mdash;holding the fruit
erect instead of drooping&mdash;makes it very easy to
gather; it is a medium-size pepper, just right
for stuffing for mangoes and a desirable size to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
pickle for winter use in salads; if the top and
bottom are removed it leaves a broad ring which
is very lovely when filled with salad and garnished
with parsley and well-blanched endive; the parts
removed may be used as pickles or added to mixed
or chopped pickles.</p>

<p>Magnum Dulce is an excellent sort for baking
when stuffed with meat or force-meat or fried.
Pimento is a new salad pepper very attractive in
shape and form but does not do so well in the
north as some of the older sorts; however, some
seasons it can be successfully grown and a few
plants set out will be well worth taking pains
with. In the warmer sections and in favorable
seasons at the north one can grow the fiery
Tabasco Pepper from which the Tabasco sauce
of commerce is made and so prepare one's supply
of this expensive relish; it requires early planting
and great attention to heat and sunshine to
succeed.</p>

<p>The little Celestial Peppers are so very attractive
when grown in pots that florists offer
them along with other greenhouse stuff; they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
just as well be grown in one's own hotbed or
house and make welcome gifts to the young housekeeper
or the city dweller who does not have the
advantage of a country garden to furnish condiments
and relishes. The little plants can be
grown in pots from the start or small plants in
the garden can be taken up and potted and will
hold their tiny scarlet fruit all winter, producing
more as the first is removed. For the sunny
kitchen or dining room window nothing is prettier
or more ornamental than a window box filled with
these little red peppers, parsley and endive.</p>

<p>Cayenne peppers can be grown for the making
of pepper vinegar; the seeds are used for this,
being separated from the husk when dry and put
into quart bottles filled with white wine vinegar;
in a few weeks the vinegar will be ready for use.
The hulls may be saved and put in cans of mixed
pickles, a few hulls adding a piquant hotness;
they may also be added to pickled onions and to
cauliflower.</p>

<p>As peppers are extremely sensitive to frost
every effort should be made to bring them along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
rapidly so that they may mature their fruit in
season; light application of nitrate will assist and
the use of poultry droppings in preparing the bed
will be of use; in dry weather a wetting with
water from the laundry will do much good. If
it is possible to pipe or carry water with hose to
the garden a shallow trench may be made along
the pepper rows and water turned in as required.
Protecting with papers or other covering on
frosty nights may save a crop but the covering
should not rest on the plants as the frost will
likely strike through; hay or corn fodder would be
likely to give better protection.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">TOMATOES</p>

<p>Are one of the most important vegetables of the
home garden not alone as a summer vegetable,
but also as an important part of the winter
cuisine, more tomatoes being canned for winter
use than all other vegetables.</p>

<p>Tomatoes require no expert care to grow; they
are one of the easiest managed of vegetables, but
they do require heat for starting if they are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
be got to bearing in season to give a bountiful
crop before frost. It takes about four months
from the time the seed is sown to produce a crop
of the main crop tomato. Some of the very early
sorts will come into bearing early in July; unfortunately,
however, these very early varieties
lack the full, delicious flavor of the later fruit.
The tomatoes should not be set in the open
ground until all danger of frost is over; they
should be given rich soil and a spadeful of manure
added to the hill in which they are planted. If
the plants are allowed to lie on the ground make
the hills four feet apart each way, but if they are
to be staked or trained on a trellis three feet will
give sufficient room; both methods of culture have
advantages; the latter keeps the fruit up off the
ground, makes pickling easy and perhaps
produces more perfect fruit; less room is required
for growing the same number of plants than
would be required for the former method. The
first method has this advantage,&mdash;the plants suffer
least in a dry season as the vines shade the
ground, and prevent the excessive evaporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of moisture and require, accordingly, less cultivation;
then the branches will root wherever they
touch the soil and so draw moisture and nourishment
from it; a much larger amount of fruit is
produced from plants allowed to rest on the
ground, and if straw is laid under the plants it
will keep them from getting soiled and rotting
if the season is wet.</p>

<p>Where the plants are to be staked a six foot
stake should be set at each hill at the time the
plant is set and the plant tied to it at intervals
as it grows. Pinch off the top as soon as it
reaches the top of the stake and remove all but
a few of the side branches, pinching in those that
remain to make a shapely plant. I think the rack
system of training is preferable to the stake.</p>

<p>A long trellis or rack, about eighteen inches
or two feet high and two feet wide, is constructed
of narrow strips of wood and placed over the
tomato rows, the plants growing up through the
center of the frame and spreading out on top of
it. This gives more bearing surface and the vines
do not need to be tied to the wood; such a trellis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
can be used for several years in succession if
stored away in a dry place when not in use. The
wire tomato supports on the market are good but
costly and quite as satisfactory ones can be made
at home from the wire or wooden hoops from
barrels, stapled to stout stakes sharpened at one
end. About three hoops should be used and three
stakes. These, too, can be stored away for future
use so that the first outlay is the last for
a number of years.</p>

<p>In setting out the plants from the hotbed select
those with the stoutest stalks; it is not material
whether they have grown tall or keeled over in
the hotbed or not if the plant appears vigorous
with a robust stem. If one has a good supply of
plants to draw from one can discard all but the
best.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_160.jpg" alt="Produce" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="xsmall"><i>The reward of your hours of pleasant labor</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Prepare the hills in advance by forking in a
forkful of old manure; if the plants are long,
make a trench two-thirds the length of the stem
with a deeper hole at one end; place the root in
the hole and bend the top carefully into the trench,
turning the tip up straight so that it stands four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
or five inches above the ground, draw in a part
of the earth and fill the trench with water, fill
in the remainder of the soil, pressing snugly,
make a fine dry mulch about the plant and the
work is done. The long stem buried in the trench
will send out roots all its length and will have a
much greater root system than a plant set with
just a few inches of stem in the ground; such a
plant set in such a way, invariably lives and makes
a strong plant, but to plant it with only the root
part under the ground would only invite the loss
of the plant.</p>

<p>The plot should be looked over the following
morning to see if cut worms have cut off any of
the plants during the night and to restore, if necessary,
the dust-mulch.</p>

<p>Plants grown on stakes or trellises are more
susceptible to frost than those grown on the
ground as the soil holds the heat and it is an easy
matter to cover a considerable number of plants
at one time with tarpaulin or even newspapers and
this should be done when there is even a slight
prospect of frost. The thermometer should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
watched in the late fall and if it is going down
towards nightfall those plants which one wishes
to save should be protected.</p>

<p>After the first three hard frosts there are
usually two or three weeks of fine weather and it
is at this time that tomatoes and other perishable
garden stuff command the highest price and
those who are fortunate enough to have a surplus
to sell can realize a neat little sum that will more
than pay for the trifling trouble involved.</p>

<p>I am often asked which is the best tomato for
the home garden and have no hesitation in saying
that, all things considered, there is no better tomato
raised, for an all season crop, than the
Dwarf, Improved Stone. There are earlier tomatoes
and larger tomatoes. The Early Detroit
is earlier, but not very much so, and it does not
compare in size and quality with the Stone. Ponderosa
is a much larger tomato but the quality is
not up to the Stone nor is its freedom from cracking
and irregularity to be compared to the Stone.
Then the Stone is such a satisfactory plant in
the way of foliage and stem, so heavy and rugged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the thick, crumply leaves are very distinctive and
the plants always command attention even when
not in fruit. The fruit is quite as large as best
requirements demand and it slices beautifully for
the table and canned is entirely free from that
peculiar taste that characterizes the commercial
tomato.</p>

<p>Earliana is the earliest and the most popular
sort of the extra early tomato and a few plants
for early use will be worth while. There is also
a new ball-shaped tomato, New Globe, that is
good for slicing as it gives a number of fine slices
just alike instead of the three usually obtained
from a flat tomato, only one&mdash;the middle&mdash;being
perfect. So if one wants a variety in the garden
one may plant with entire confidence the Dwarf
Stone and Vaughan's Improved New Stone and
add for variety the Earliana and the New Globe.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SQUASH<br />
ENGLISH MARROW</p>

<p>In sections where the eggplant does not do
well, or where one lacks the skill to succeed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
it a very satisfactory substitute will be found in
the English marrow; this is a bush form of the
vegetable marrows and occupies about as much
ground as an eggplant. The vine sorts are such
rampant growers that they require a garden to
themselves or at least a walled enclosure, but they
are very profitable to grow as they produce
enormously and the fruit is excellent fried like
eggplant; few, if any, persons would be able to
distinguish between them and the difference, if
any, would be in favor of the marrow.</p>

<p>Rich warm soil is required for all the squash
family and the bush varieties are no exceptions.
Give in addition to the usual manuring of the
garden a good forkful of manure in each hill.
Space the hills four feet apart each way and
plant several seeds in each hill to provide for
the appetite of the squash bugs which make no
exception in favor of bush varieties; when danger
of bugs is past the plants should be thinned to
three or four plants in a hill.</p>

<p>To repel the squash vine borer scatter a handful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
of tobacco dust about the plants and at the
first appearance of wilt in the leaves examine the
stems carefully for the point where the worm
found entrance and either slit the stalk sufficiently
to uncover the worm or run a wire up the stalk
until he is encountered and killed; then if possible,
bury the wound in soil so that the branch
may be saved; if, however, there is too much injury
done or the wound is too high up it will be
best to remove that part of the branch; at the
same time the rest of the plants should be carefully
examined for other signs of injury, and
the ground inspected for larv&aelig;. For yellow
striped beetle and blight spray early and repeatedly
with Bordeaux arsenate of lead mixture.</p>

<p>The marrows are finer eating when only two-thirds
grown. They should be peeled, sliced and
covered with salt for an hour, then rinsed and
drained and breaded and fried the same as eggplant,
or, if preferred, may be cooked and mashed
like summer squash. They are good either way.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">TURNIPS</p>

<p>Have an important place in the garden as they
may be used as a catch crop almost any time
during summer. Wherever vacancies occur in
rows of early vegetables and it is inconvenient
owing to lack of seed or other reasons to replant
with the same vegetable, then one may have recourse
to the ever useful turnip and fill in the
hiatus with that. Turnips are at their best when
young and tender, about three inches in diameter,
and a constant succession can be assured by
planting in this way or where the first crop of
vegetables has been removed. For fall and winter
use sowings may be made in July and August.
Success frequently results from sowing among
the sweet corn just before the last cultivation;
with favorable weather a crop will mature before
severe freezing weather and turnips are the better
for a touch of frost.</p>

<p>Open a shallow drill with the hand plough or
by dragging the corner of the hoe along the row
and scatter the seed very thinly. If the planting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
is in full rows make them a foot or fifteen inches
apart. As soon as the plants are large enough,
thin to stand three or four inches apart; this is
important as fine, smooth roots cannot be produced
if crowded.</p>

<p>The turnip maggot is the greatest enemy the
turnip has and it sometimes appears in gardens
that have been entirely free from it and I think
is brought in the seed. It is the same little
worm that works its tortuous way through and
around the radish and, although I have never
grown a wormy radish, still last season an entire
planting of turnips were ruined by this pest, so
as I was quite sure it was not previously present
in the soil I am forced to the conviction that I
bought and planted it together with the seed.
Moral&mdash;Buy seed of reliable dealers and examine
carefully for worm holes before planting.</p>

<p>The Purple-top White Globe is a most popular
market sort. Snowball is a white variety of
fine appearance and early maturity and if used
young is very tender and sweet. Early White
Egg is another good early sort and for those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
like a yellow turnip the Yellow Globe is a satisfactory
sort. It makes a larger root than the
others and is excellent both for table use and for
feeding stock. It is a dependable root for feeding
Belgian or other hares as it keeps well, buried
in earth in a frost-proof cellar, and when gathered
for winter use the tops can be piled in a cool place
and fed to the bunnies. Of course this applies
to all turnips which are grown for winter use.</p>

<p>The planting of turnips, radishes and cabbage
should be watched closely for signs of the root
maggot. The presence of a little, dark-colored
fly about the plant is always cause for suspicion
and when seen it will be well to take precautionary
measures. As tobacco in any form is obnoxious
to most insect life, the strewing of tobacco
dust on the ground will usually drive these
flies away and prevent the laying of eggs,
but the trouble is that they may have already
laid eggs before being discovered. Hot water
poured around the plant in sufficient quantity to
soak the soil an inch or so will often destroy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
eggs and larv&aelig; too. Soaking the ground with
Paris green solution&mdash;a teaspoonful of the poison
to a large watering pot of water is sufficient and
the solution must be kept stirred to prevent its
settling&mdash;will destroy the maggot, but it may also
poison the turnip so is not to be recommended;
also, if the worm has attacked the radish or turnip
and rendered it unsightly and unfit for the
table, tobacco and hot water then are the two
safest and most reliable applications and the
hot water over the tobacco is especially effective.</p>

<p>Disks made from heavy tar paper are sold for
the protection of cabbage and cauliflower plants
and may be cheaply made at home and though a
little more trouble to apply about turnips and
radishes still are practical and better than losing
the crop. The disks may be either round or
square and should be about three inches in diameter
with a hole the size of the stem in the center
and a slit extending out from the hole on one side
to the edge; this allows the disk to be slipped
around the stem of the plant. A leather punch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
which will cut a quarter of an inch hole may be
used and the slit made to the center of the disk
and the hole then cut. The disk lies flat on the
ground and prevents the entrance of the fly to
deposit the egg and the tar paper repels.</p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">3</a> Corn should not be planted in single rows for this reason:&mdash;when
the corn blooms the pollen is carried from ear to ear, and
from plant to plant. If a single row is planted broadside to the
prevailing wind, the pollen is dissipated and the corn remains unfertilized
and produces no ears. Three or more rows insures
against this loss of pollenization. If only a limited number of
hills are to be planted it will be better to plant them in blocks
rather than in one or two long rows. Corn that matures at different
seasons should not be planted in parallel single rows as
the result would be the same as one single row&mdash;the corn not
blooming at the same time. Again, corn of two different sorts
should not be in adjoining, parallel rows, rather should each kind
be planted in blocks to avoid hybridizing. Where it is necessary
to give a long strip of land to the sweet corn it may be divided
into blocks, especially if the strip extends from north to south,
as the prevailing winds are quite uniformly from east or west
and there is little trouble with cross pollenizing from south to
north.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">VEGETABLES OF THE VINE FAMILY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CUCUMBERS</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">For</span> main crop or pickle cucumbers should
be planted in the open ground from June
until the middle of July; at this season there is
less danger of damage from the striped cucumber
beetle and the stink bug, both serious enemies of
the vine family; but even so late in the season
it will be well to take the easy precaution of strewing
tobacco stems or dust on the hill about the
plants.</p>

<p>For pickles plant in hills four to six feet apart
each way and keep the entire surface of the
ground clean with frequent cultivation. Hoeing
about the hills and running the hand cultivator
with the scuffle-hoe attachment between the hills
will be sufficient, but no weeds should be allowed
to make a start, as once the vines have begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
cover the ground it will be difficult to eradicate
the weeds and the vines must not be tramped on
or handled unnecessarily. When the plants are
a foot long pinch out the ends of the branches to
induce branching and check too rampant a
growth. Pull up all but three or four plants
when all danger of bugs is past. Keep a close
watch for root maggot, borer, and wilt. Spray
with Bordeaux arsenate of lead mixture at the
first appearance of wilt, and continue once a
week until the fruit appears; after that it will not
be safe to use the poison.</p>

<p>Gather the pickles frequently&mdash;every other day
if bearing well; do not allow fruit to grow large
or ripen on the vines if grown for pickles as this
will check production.</p>

<p>One of the best table varieties is Early Fortune&mdash;also
a desirable pickling variety. Arlington,
White Spine and Davis's Perfect are excellent
table sorts and Chicago Pickle&mdash;a standard pickle
sort&mdash;and Long Green, or Jersey Pickle and the
Westerfield's Chicago Pickle are all excellent
types for growing for pickles.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CITRON</p>

<p>Used for preserving and for sweet pickles, require
the same treatment as melons and squash.
Seed may be planted directly in the open ground
or started on pieces of sod in the hotbed; this is
preferable as the fruit sometimes fails to ripen
in a short season and unless fully ripened on
the vine the preserves have a watery taste, no
matter how carefully prepared. Citron make
about the same length of vine as the watermelon
so should be planted from five to six feet apart,
and when the vines are a foot in length the tips
should be pinched off to induce branching and
check too straying a habit. Keep cultivated, remembering
that the dust-mulch is the best garden
insurance and spray with Bordeaux mixture
against blight and use tobacco dust liberally as a
preventive measure against the yellow striped
beetle and the squash bug.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">MUSK MELONS</p>

<p>In securing seed for growing musk melons one
should take into consideration the climate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the length of the growing season. Certain varieties
of melon require certain climatic conditions
and will not give satisfaction if these are lacking.
Melons that are adapted to the climate of Colorado&mdash;like
the Rocky Ford, the Honey Dew and
the like seldom do well in the east and middle
west where early frosts are apt to find the fruit
still immature, but there are many other excellent
varieties well adapted to these sections. The
Extra Early Hackensack, the Osage, the Irondequoit
and others can be grown with satisfaction
and all are especially fine and large.</p>

<p>As a general thing I think a large melon, sweetness
and flavor being equal, preferable. One
of the sweetest melons with which I am acquainted
is the old Cassaba; this is the largest
musk melon grown&mdash;a perfect specimen being
from twelve to fifteen inches in length and as
much as one wishes to carry up from the garden,
but the delicate green flesh is melted sugar, nothing
less, with a flavor all its own.</p>

<p>For an early crop of melons one should start
the seed in the hotbed on squares of sod, using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
plenty of seed so that one will have an assured
stand, and transplant when all danger of frost
is past. If one only grows a few hills it will well
repay one for the extra trouble to cover the hills
with shallow boxes, covered with wire netting or
mosquito netting. The boxes should not be
more than four inches high and about twelve
inches square, or thereabouts; if removed as soon
as danger of bugs is past and stored in a dry
place they will last for a number of years.
Empty biscuit boxes sawed in two make good
frames or strips of three inch lumber can quickly
be converted into frames by any one handy with
hammer and saw.</p>

<p>Dry weather is one of the serious drawbacks to
melon culture as the drought usually comes just
as the fruit is setting. Sinking tin cans, with
holes punched in the sides near the bottom, to
the top in the soil in the middle of the hill and
keeping them filled with water will be of much
assistance in bringing the fruit on to maturity.
Occasionally too much rain interferes with the
ripening of the fruit; in such cases the empty can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
will act as a drain pipe by accumulating water
from the surface soil. The glass plant protectors
used in early spring are helpful in concentrating
the little sunshine cloudy weather affords and
where these are not available old window glass
may be used to afford protection from rain and
wind for a few days. This should be supported
on the north side by a frame or stout stakes,
their lower edge resting on the ground.</p>

<p>The best soil for melons is a warm, sandy soil
well enriched with barnyard manure and a supplementary
shovelful should be placed in each
hill. Make the hills about six feet apart each
way, and thin out to three plants to a hill. If
desired such small sorts as Rocky Ford, Paul
Rose, Hoodoo and the like may be grown on
netting; they will not, perhaps, bear as freely,
but the fruit will be more perfect than when
grown on the ground, and there is this advantage
that the fruit drops when perfectly ripe so that
there is no uncertainty about gathering it.
Where there is only a small garden spot available
the growing of melons, cucumbers and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
like on netting is a distinct advantage; the cultivation
then becomes as simple as that of a row
of peas and can be continued throughout the
season; gathering the fruit is much simplified as
there are no vines to be trampled on and if water
is needed it can be quickly applied along the row.
Melons grown on netting are easily protected
from early frost, but it is difficult to cover any
considerable area on the ground.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">WATERMELONS</p>

<p>Require the same treatment as musk-melons
except that it is all right that they should be
started in the open ground, spacing the hills from
eight to ten feet apart each way; giving a spadeful
of manure in each hill. Spray with Bordeaux
arsenate of lead mixture once or twice,
using a much weaker dilution than for other vines.
Pinch out the ends of the vines. Keep cultivated
and free from weeds. Avoid stepping on
the vines or handling them unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Cole's Early, Kleckley Sweet and the new
melon&mdash;Tom Watson&mdash;are all good sorts of much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
sweetness and crispness of flesh. The first is
well adapted to the northern states, the Kleckley
a few days later than Cole's Early. A few Winter
Watermelons will extend the season long
into the winter as this variety may be gathered
at the approach of cold weather and stored in a
cool, frost-proof cellar and will retain its delicious
flavor and sweetness for weeks. Unlike the other
melons mentioned, which are oblong and green,
and very tender of rind, the Winter is round,
nearly white-skinned and of a hardness approaching
the citron. The flesh, however, is red and
very firm. It must not be concluded that the
Winter is a late season melon, for it is one of the
earliest, continuing to bear until frost cuts the
vines, so that it may be grown for a single melon
crop if desired.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SQUASH</p>

<p>Winter squash are an important garden product,
not much appreciated during the flush
times of summer but coming into its own at the
approach of cold weather; the culture is practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
that of all vine products. Starting seed
on sod in the hotbed and transplanting has much
to recommend it as the squash seems to attract
more than a fair sort of attention from striped
cucumber beetle, squash bugs, stink worm and
blight. The vine borer also takes its tithe of the
plant and a sudden wilting of the leaves is indication
that he is at work; he should be hunted for
and killed. Usually there is little hopes of saving
the injured branch; if anything will do it
it will be burying the wound in earth and keeping
it moist for a time until it either heals or sends
out roots at the nearest joint and so becomes an
independent plant.</p>

<p>As a rule squash, melons, cucumbers and the
like will not transplant. It often happens that
about all of the seed planted in some hills will
germinate and make strong plants while other
hills will have but one or two plants and it is desired
to transplant some of the extra plants into
hills where they are needed; attempts to do this
with a trowel invariably fail; it is possible, however,
to transplant an entire hill&mdash;or a part of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
if spaced far enough apart, by passing a spade
down into the ground at a sufficient distance from
the plant to avoid disturbing the roots and lifting
a large spadeful of earth with the plants. The
hill that is to receive them should have been prepared
in advance so that the earth may slide off
the spade into the hole without disturbing or
breaking it in the least; the soil should not be
pressed down as this would have a tendency to
crumble, but any space about it should be filled
in carefully and water poured around it. Squash
or other vines moved in this way invariably live
and go on growing without any appreciable setback.
A considerable patch of winter squash&mdash;the
Delicious&mdash;was entirely secured by taking
up plants that had come up self sown in various
places; somewhere some immature squash were
left in the garden the fall before; some came from
the frame around a standpipe in the barnyard
which was filled with coal ashes. How the squash
came to come up in that unusual place is unknown,
but there were a number of nice plants
and these were lifted on the spade and carried&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
spadeful at a time&mdash;and planted where they
were wanted and the entire patch was very thrifty
and bore abundantly.</p>

<p>Spraying, hand picking and attention to cultivation
are essential in growing squash as with
other garden crops. The dust-mulch is the one
certain assurance against failure.</p>

<p>The Hubbard Squash, both Golden and
Warted, have long been standard sorts, but both
have lost, through much careless breeding, the
qualities which distinguished them&mdash;dryness and
sweetness. It is practically impossible of late
years to find an individual of either variety that
is really dry or sweet or that has keeping qualities
equal to the early sorts. In the Delicious
we have a much superior squash whose dryness
is notable and sweetness all that one could desire,
even small, immature specimens possess the
quality in high degree. Unless one has home
grown seed from a Hubbard that was perfect in
these qualities I should advise planting the seed
of Delicious and saving one's own seed from the
best specimen of that.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SUMMER SQUASH</p>

<p>Then there are all the varieties of summer
squashes&mdash;Summer Crookneck, Giant Summer
Crookneck, the Vegetable Marrows, and the
several bush forms, which are a boon to the small
kitchen garden as they take little room and are
always within bounds; they include the Bush
Fordhook, used as a summer squash when green,
or ripe, a good keeper, often lasting until the next
season's crop is ready. The Mammoth White
Bush or Patty Pan, Early Yellow Bush, Early
Golden Bush and Bush English Marrow are all
good sorts&mdash;either cooked and mashed or egged
and fried like eggplant. All require the same
general treatment and all bear heavily and early.
The summer squash are planted in the open
ground any time that is suitable for planting
corn. To guard against loss by seed decaying in
the ground if the season is wet, set the seeds on
edge, instead of laying them flat; this is advisable
with all flat seeds of pronounced size; cover half
an inch and mark the hills so that cultivation can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
commence at once. Covering the hills with
frames will save much work in combating insects
or a cap of window screening will be effectual;
this is made from a round piece of netting with a
slit on one side from center to edge to allow its
being bent in a tent shape. A stick should be
fastened to it to hold it together and anchor it to
the ground; this can be easily arranged by taking
a piece of wood four or five inches longer than the
cap and splitting it half its length, inserting the
wire where it laps into the split and thrusting the
free end into the ground. These little caps are
very practical as they can be flattened out and laid
away when no longer required, occupying very
little space to store and for that reason are preferable
to the boxes.</p>

<p>Squash vines may be kept from growing too
rampant by shortening the branches. They
should always be pinched back as soon as they
have made a foot, or less, of growth and when
fruit is well set on the vines the ends may be
severely cut back to insure the early maturity
of the fruit already set. I have removed branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
several feet long and bearing half-grown squash
from vines of the English marrow without the
least ill effect and have no doubt that similar
treatment would be well borne by the Hubbard
or other winter squash, and so save much useless
growth and conserve the strength of the vine for
the main crop of squash and, perhaps, induce a
dryer, sweeter product.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SWEET POTATOES</p>

<p>The easiest way to raise one's own sweet potatoes
is to buy already started plants of the market
gardeners who make a business of starting
them for sale; but if one prefers to plant the
tubers and raise one's own plants, and the potatoes
are available&mdash;which seldom is the case unless
one has kept them over in a warm cellar
buried in sand&mdash;then the potatoes are cut the same
as Irish potatoes, one eye to a piece, and started
in a warm hotbed in April. Before planting
the pieces of potato it is a wise precaution to
dip each piece in sulphur to protect against black
rot. The plants should not be set out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
open ground until the nights are warm and all
danger of frost is passed. The hills should be
three feet apart each way at least as the vines
make quite a rank growth. Warm, sandy soil,
well fertilized, is necessary and a trowelful of
poultry droppings may be added to each hill for
good results. Cultivate thoroughly and often
and when the vines become too long to make cultivating
convenient they may be lifted and coiled
around the top of the hill, the hill, by the way,
not being a hill at all in the common acceptance
of the term but merely a level space devoted to
the growing of the potato. It is quite important
that the ground immediately about the plant be
kept clean, so that when the vines are coiled up
they need not be again disturbed to remove weeds.</p>

<p>The space between the plants should be kept
mellow and free from weeds throughout the
growing season. Sweet potatoes are quite as
easy to grow as Irish potatoes, easier, in fact, as
they have fewer enemies and are not attacked by
the potato beetle. They are more difficult to
keep, however, and should be stored in boxes of
dry sand in a warm, dry cellar over winter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="small">VEGETABLES LESS COMMONLY GROWN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> is a considerable number of vegetables
that are seldom encountered in the general
garden, many of which are well worthy of acquaintance.
Many of them are familiar to the
city housekeper through the medium of the fruit
stores and the delicatessen stores; more of them
appear in the gardens of the foreign residents and
might be adopted for general cultivation with
good results.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">ARTICHOKES</p>

<p>Which appear as an especial delicacy on the
menus of the big hotels and restaurants on special
occasions only, are not difficult to grow in sections
of the country where the winters are not too severe.
They will not stand the winters of the
northern states, however, and in any longitude
north of the Ohio, are better for winter protection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Given a mild winter climate they are as
easily raised as a cabbage or an ear of corn and
are far more ornamental, indeed so striking and
handsome are the plants that they may be grown
for their effectiveness alone.</p>

<p>The plants are grown from seed started in a
hotbed in March or earlier and planted out in
rich mellow soil when the weather is suitable.
Set the plants three feet apart each way. The
plants do not bear until the second year, but they
may be had in cold sections by purchasing the
plants of the florist at any time after the middle
of April. As many undesirable sorts are often
obtained from seed it is a more certain way of getting
good varieties to purchase the plants. They
are, however, more expensive than other vegetable
plants and where they can not be carried over the
winter are somewhat expensive, costing one dollar
and fifty cents a dozen. However, a dozen will
be ample for a small family.</p>

<p>The unopened flower head is the part eaten and
it is served raw as a salad or cooked in various
ways as an entr&eacute;e.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>They should receive the same culture as okra or
corn, thorough cultivation and water if the season
is unduly dry. At the approach of severe
weather the tops should be cut off close to the
crown and the plants banked up with coal ashes,
which should be removed in the spring before
growth begins.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">ARTICHOKE, JERUSALEM</p>

<p>Though sometimes used as a vegetable and for
pickling is especially valuable for feeding stock,
especially swine which are allowed to harvest it by
rooting it out of the ground. It is claimed that
an acre of ground planted to artichoke will keep
from twenty to thirty hogs from October to April.
They have a special value as a means of clearing
a piece of land of undesirable weed growths&mdash;like
Canada Thistle, quack grass or locust
sprouts, as the hogs in rooting for the tubers will
destroy the weed roots, thus redeeming a piece
of land that may be utilized for garden crops or
fruit.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>In planting the tubers are cut and planted the
same as potatoes and cultivated in the same way
until the crop is matured sufficiently to turn the
hogs on it or they may be harvested to feed during
winter to any stock which needs a succulent winter
food.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">BROCCOLI</p>

<p>A vegetable similar to cauliflower, but of somewhat
coarser flavor. It is hardier than cauliflower
and will do well in sections where cauliflower
is not successfully grown. For rapid
growth it should receive frequent cultivation and
be grown in rich soil. Sow seed very early in
greenhouse, hotbed or warm window and set
out as soon as the ground can be prepared in
spring, setting the plants the same distance apart
as cabbage and drawing the earth up about the
roots when hoeing. White Cap is about the best
variety, making fine, large, compact heads of a
creamy-white color, of good flavor.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">BRUSSELS SPROUTS</p>

<p>These little miniature cabbages, growing
closely together on a stalk, are delicious boiled
like cabbage or used as a salad. The culture is the
same as that accorded cabbage. The seed should
be sown in the hotbed in spring and set out in
the open ground in May in rows three feet apart
and about twenty inches apart in the rows. Cultivate
to keep down weeds and maintain a dust-mulch.
By fall the little heads will be fully developed.
The delicate flavor is improved by
a touch of frost. For late use sow seed in June.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CHICORY</p>

<p>Sow seed in the open ground early in spring as
for parsnips, thinning to stand three inches apart
in the rows and making the rows fifteen inches
apart. Dig the roots in the fall and store in a
dark cellar where the temperature can be controlled.
Cut the leaves off a little above the
root crown and place them in horizontal layers
with the crowns outward covering each layer, excepting
the tip of the crown, with earth. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
layer should be a little narrower than the one beneath
so that they form a sloping bank. It is
the tender white leaves produced in the dark that
are used for salad. Another form of Chicory,
the Large Rooted, is used to mix with or substitute
for coffee, being sliced, dried, roasted and
ground.</p>

<p>Witloof Chicory, or French Endive as it is
sold by dealers in fancy fruits and vegetables, is
sown in June in drills a foot apart and cultivated
until frost, when the plants should be taken up
and trimmed to an inch and a half from the neck
and replaced upright in trenches about sixteen
inches deep, setting the plants about an inch and a
half apart. The trench is then filled in with soil
and covered with manure to hasten growth. The
tender, white tops will be ready for use in about a
month and are eaten raw, like celery, used as a
salad or cooked.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CELERIAC</p>

<p>Or turnip-rooted celery is grown for its bulbous
root, which has a distinct celery flavor and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
gardens where celery will not succeed it makes
a very good substitute. It is used, cooked, either
as a salad or as a vegetable. It is cultivated
much as celery is, only it does not require the
banking so necessary with that plant. It may,
however, be blanched and is said to be very fine
that way. Delicatesse is a fine sort with perfectly
smooth root, free from side rootlets, pure
white, tender and excellent in quality. Giant
Prague is another fine sort. Earliest of All is
ready for use in June and is a good sort.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CHERVILLE</p>

<p>Resembles parsley and is used for garnishing
and for seasoning. Cultivate like parsley, making
the rows a foot apart and thin to six inches.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">COLLARDS</p>

<p>Grown at the south as greens and as a substitute
for cabbage. Plant seed in rows, thinning
or transplanting to a foot apart in the row. It is
improved by a touch of frost.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CORN SALAD</p>

<p>Sow in spring in drills a foot apart. For
winter and spring use sow in drills in August
and September and cultivate like lettuce or other
salad stuff.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CRESS</p>

<p>Upland Cress, which has the flavor of water-cress,
can be grown in any good garden soil without
the presence of water. The seed should be
sown very freely in rows one foot apart, making
repeated sowings for succession as the plant soon
runs to seed. Water-cress can be grown about a
water hydrant if the soil is clayey, or can be
underlaid with a few inches of clay. Water-cress
sown at intervals in such a position will give
a supply of the pungent green that will be a very
welcome addition to lettuce, corn or other salad.
Remove a foot or eighteen inches of the soil for
a square yard of space and in the excavation thus
formed lay a few inches of clay, tamping and
puddling it down until it makes a continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
layer, then apply a few inches of earth rich in
humus or marsh earth, leaving the surface
slightly lower than the surrounding soil and
scatter the seed broadcast and keep free from
weeds until up and growing. Allow the hydrant
to drip sufficiently to maintain sufficient moisture.
Continue to scatter seeds at intervals for a succession
of cress.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">DANDELION</p>

<p>For those who love the bitter tang of the
dandelion as a green, the cultivated affords a
much finer dish than the wild as the leaves are
double the size of the wild dandelion. The seed
should be sown in drills, covering very lightly and
shading with newspapers or brush until up.
Thin to stand a foot apart and blanch, if desired,
by inverting a box or flower-pot over each plant,
or a cone of stiff paper can be used. For greens,
only the top may be removed but for salad the
plant may be cut down to the root, the part beneath
the surface of the ground being very white
and tender. There is no danger of dandelion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
grown in the garden becoming a troublesome
weed as it is easily kept from seeding, which
is its only way of spreading.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">FENNEL OR FINOCCHIO</p>

<p>Is extensively used in Italy as a salad. The
part used is the enlargement of the leaf stalk at
the base of the stem. When this is about the
size of an egg, the earth should be drawn up about
the plant to cover the enlargement partly and in
a week or ten days the eggs maybe used, removing
as many as required, a succession being produced.
The flavor is delicate, resembling celery,
and it may be used either as a salad or boiled.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">GARLIC</p>

<p>So beloved of the Italians is quite worth cultivating
in our American gardens. It is used in
minute quantities as a seasoning in almost all
forms of savory cooking, in omelets, salads,
soups, dressings and wherever a piquant flavor,
suggestive of onion, but distinctive, is desired.
The garlic comes in a bunch of cloves which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
separated and planted like onion sets an inch
apart, but it requires warmer weather than the
onion, succeeding especially well in the climate
of California. It is, however, indigenous in a
wild state in many parts of the country and cattle
browsing in garlic-infested pastures have a distinctive
garlicky flavor to their milk. So agreeable
is the taste of garlic or leeks in butter to some
people that it was once quite common in the Philadelphia
markets to hear "leeky butter" inquired
for.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">KALE OR BORECOLE</p>

<p>Are grown for greens and as a substitute for
cabbage, being more hardy than that vegetable.
For summer use sow the seed in the open ground
in May or June and cultivate the same as cabbage.
For early spring use, sow seed in September
and protect during winter. Some of the
varieties, like Imperial Long-standing Kale, are
so hardy that they may be dug out from under
the snow in the winter. Dwarf Curled Scotch
is an excellent sort, very tender and fine flavored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
and with beautiful curled foliage. Dwarf Green
Curled Kale and Excelsior Moss Curled Kale
are other good sorts, very mossy, attractive and
delicious.</p>

<p>Sea Kale, less well known than the annual
kale, is a hardy perennial that is cultivated somewhat
like asparagus, the seed being sown in the
spring in rows three to four feet apart. The
seedlings give a crop the third year but quicker
results come from planting root cuttings or offsets.
The Sea Kale has a very long tap-root and
should be grown in rich mellow soil that has been
ploughed or dug very deep. As soon as shoots
show above the ground blanch with boards, earth,
sand or anything that will exclude light until
ready for use. When blanched the leaf-stalk is
cooked like asparagus or the leaves are used as
greens.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">KOHL-RABI</p>

<p>(Turnip-rooted cabbage)</p>

<p>The bulb which grows on the stalk a few inches
above the ground is the edible part of this vegetable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
This is stripped and cooked like turnips,
but is much more sweet and delicate. Sow seed
in the open ground in June, making the rows
sixteen inches apart and thin to six inches in the
rows. Sow for succession from early spring
until July. Cultivate like cabbage.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">LEEKS</p>

<p>Sow seed in April in drills one foot apart and
one inch deep. Transplant when large enough
to handle or thin to stand six inches apart in the
rows, setting the plants as deep as possible so
that the earth will come up well about the neck
to blanch and insure its whiteness and tenderness.
In cultivating draw the earth up about the plants.
Seed may also be sown in August or September,
the same as onions, and the plants transplanted
the following spring.</p>

<p>Prizetaker Leek is a fine exhibition sort.
Large Musselburg has enormous broad leaves
and a pleasant flavor. Long Mezieres also has
broad, erect leaves, fine flavor and a long, snow-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
stem and is very hardy. Leeks are a valuable
addition to the onion family of the garden.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">MARTYNIA</p>

<p>The curious pods of this vine vegetable are
used for pickling and produce a very fancy
article. They should be gathered when only half
grown. Sow the seed in the hotbed in spring and
transplant into hills three feet apart each way
and cultivate the same as cucumbers. The
plants will self-sow and voluntary plants will

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="small">SWEET, POT AND MEDICINAL HERBS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Are</span> a very welcome addition to the kitchen
garden, giving just the often needed touch
to the achievement of a successful dish, a touch
that will change an everyday vegetable or meat
course to something unusual and fancy in
cuisine, and with no trouble or added expense
to the cook&mdash;just a little pinch of this or that,
and what a difference it makes! In most households
sage is depended on for the flavoring of
poultry dressing, sausage and the like, in spite of
the fact that it may be anything but pleasing to
some member of the family or the welcome guest;
so accustomed are we to its use that substitution
is scarcely thought of, and yet a very pleasing
one is found in summer savory, which most
people like better than sage, once its acquaintance
is made. Coriander and caraway seeds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
used in bread, cake and cookies, but just a touch
of caraway is a very piquant addition to salads.
Tarragon is used for making tarragon vinegar&mdash;the
leaves being steeped in pale cider or white
wine vinegar until the flavor is extracted and
then used in the concoction of salad dressing.
Dill is used principally for making dill pickles,
the leaves being laid alternately with the pickles
when laid down. Sweet fennel is used for
salads and soups and also for fish sauce.</p>

<p>If one has a strip of land at one side of the
garden that is not needed, and can be conveniently
skipped in the plowing, that will be the
place for the herb bed. The soil should be rich
and mellow and contain a fair proportion of
humus. A poor strip of land may be built up
by adding to it from season to season the old
manure from the hotbed; this is nearly reduced
to humus and the action of the elements will soon
complete its transformation.</p>

<p>As many of the herbs are perennial it is best
that the bed should be a permanent one, not subject
to annual disturbance. It should be long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
rather than wide, so that the herbs may be
gathered without walking on the bed; three feet
is a good width as that can be reached across
fairly well. As the amount of any one herb used
in the average family will be small it is not necessary
that they be set in regular rows; they may
rather be started in rows, for convenience in
planting and identifying when up and then the
fine, vigorous plants set in clumps in the border,
or in colonies of sorts. The leaves of the various
plants are the part used and they should be cut
or gathered on a bright, clear day just as the
plants are coming into bloom, tied in bunches
and hung up in a dry place, an attic with open
windows, or a shed, or spread out on racks or a
floor, anywhere where they will dry quickly so
as to retain all their flavor. When thoroughly
dry the leaves should be stripped from the stems
and packed in bags or boxes for use.</p>

<p>The annual varieties are cultivated the same
as the perennials but if one prefers these may occupy
a row through the garden where they can
have the cultivation accorded the other vegetables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
The following list is quite complete and
will indicate the various uses for which each is
suitable.</p>

<span class="small">PLANT ENEMIES AND INSECTICIDES</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> well-tended garden does not suffer
materially from inroads of insect pests
especially in favorable seasons; cool, damp
weather, and hot, muggy weather are conducive
to fungoid diseases which sap the strength of the
plants and make them less resistant to any kind
of assaults, whether of insects or disease, but with
normal weather and bright dry air a part of each
day at least, little trouble should be experienced
from insect pests; especially should this be the
case if precautionary work has been done the
previous fall in the way of gathering up and
burning all rubbish that can harbor insects or
disease and especially if the precaution is taken
to fall plough the garden, leaving the soil in the
rough furrow over winter. This is especially
good practice when there has been trouble with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
insect pests, especially cutworms, root lice,
tomato worms&mdash;the pupae of which winter in the
ground and if turned up by the plough will be destroyed,
radish and cabbage maggot and the like.</p>

<p>Even though the past season has been practically
free from trouble of this sort the intelligent
gardener will recognize the possibility of trouble
and in time of peace will prepare for war by supplying
himself with the more common and useful
varieties of insecticides. It is not desirable
that the list should include everything in the
bug pharmacop&aelig;ia; a few standard remedies
faithfully and intelligently used are far better
than an embarrassing assortment that leaves one
undecided as to which is best and often results in
half-hearted use of first one and then the other,
with lax intervals which give the enemy time to
recuperate and multiply.</p>

<p>It is best in deciding upon the insecticides and
fungicides to be used to have a clear classification
in mind of the several kinds of insect to be
exterminated as one form of poison may not be
suited to all forms of insect life: for instance, insects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
which chew or eat the leaves of the plants
to which they are addicted, as the potato beetle,
caterpillar and the like, can most readily be destroyed
by poison applied to the foliage; insects
which do not eat the vegetation on the surface,
but puncture it and drain away by suction the
juices of the plant, like the aphis and other plant
lice, will not be injured by surface poison, but
must be destroyed by the contact of corrosive
poison with their bodies, or with hot water, which
is one of the best insecticides known, not only destroying
all insect life with which it comes in contact,
but cleansing and strengthening the plants.
It should be used as a spray at about a hundred
and forty degrees, taking pains to reach the
underside of the leaves as well as the upper surface,
and as it can be used when the fruit is in any
stage of growth its advantage is obvious.</p>

<p>For the eating or chewing insects and beetles
there are several reliable poisons on the market,
all ready for use, needing only to be mixed with a
definite bulk of water, flour or lime, according as
the poison is to be used as a dust or a spray.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="small">WINTER STORAGE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is in the late days of fall that one begins
to realize substantially on the summer's investment
of seed, time and labor in the garden.
Previous to this one has watched the maturing
of the summer vegetables with an eye to their
immediate use; now one sees before one rich
stores of food that shall tide one safely through
many lean days when the price of food goes soaring
and the visible supply temporarily disappears.
If one is putting into cellar storage an
abundance of such sugar producing vegetables
as beets, squashes, carrots, parsnips and the like
one need not fear any injury to the health of the
family from a lack of sugar if these are used
freely, for they will convert themselves into the
needed sweet and although they may not be quite
so palatable as cake and candy will supply their
place in the economy of the physical system.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>Most winter vegetables need to be kept in cold
storage, not in a warm, dry place; for this reason
a furnace-heated cellar is not satisfactory, but an
adjoining room that is connected by a door that
can be opened to admit warm air in a severe spell
of winter weather is desirable. For certain roots
that are not injured by a low temperature, or
even slight freezing, an earth cellar is satisfactory.
A cellar of this sort usually admits of
piling vegetables on the floor or in pens on the
floor and throwing dirt over them to exclude the
air and prevent evaporation, and as the vegetables
are used the surplus earth can be thrown
out on the floor and the labor of storing is much
lessened, for it is no small task to carry heavy
baskets of earth into the vegetable cellar and to
remove it again in the spring. If a small room
can be arranged adjoining the cellar proper and
bins divided off around the sides and the earth
allowed to remain from year to year the task of
winter storage will be slight. Beets, carrots,
turnips, cabbage, parsnips, salsify, celery, all
these things belong in the earth cellar and apples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
too, may be stored in baskets, barrels or boxes
here and will not be injured by light freezing, as
it is heat and dry atmosphere that most militate
against the successful keeping of winter apples.</p>

<p>A few other vegetables call for dry, rather
warm quarters, like the winter squash, onion,
sweet and Irish potato, but good ventilation is
indispensable for all. The chief merit of the root-cellar
lies in the fact that it can be well ventilated,
the windows being opened at times when it would
be untenable to open them in rooms devoted to
the storage of canned fruit and like perishable
things. The windows in the vegetable cellar
should not be permanently closed until severe
winter weather, though they may be closed during
storms and sharp falls of temperature. I
have found that the losses from frost were less in
direct proportion to the amount of fresh air admitted
and in some mild winters the windows
have remained open the entire time, the covering
of earth being sufficient to preserve the vegetables
in excellent shape until spring. Even
when such things as are usually stored in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
earth cellar are frozen stiff, they will be quite
usable if thawed out in cold water. The water
will draw the ice to the surface and it should be
allowed to thaw, when the vegetables will be
found entirely usable, but any vegetable that
thaws out soft is beyond redemption and should
at once be discarded. Also any vegetables found
decaying in the cellar should at once be removed
and the cause also removed. Usually it will be
found that too much heat and too little fresh air
are the trouble; opening a window will rectify
both troubles.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">POTATOES</p>

<p>Being our most important winter vegetables
should be stored with great care. Practically
their storage begins in the field when they are
dug; they should be dug on a bright, dry day,
preferably in the morning that the tubers should
have time to dry off if at all damp, before being
picked up and carried in. It will pay to sort in
the field as they are gathered, throwing the culls&mdash;small
potatoes and any that have been injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
in digging&mdash;by themselves. These will be of
value for feeding poultry, rabbits, goats and any
stock on the place; they are excellent for horses,
keeping the skin and coat in fine shape. Potatoes
may lie on the ground in the sun long enough
to dry off thoroughly, but not longer; left exposed
to the light they will turn green and this
discoloration is poisonous. They should be
turned over once so that the under side of the potatoes
may dry equally.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_224.jpg" alt="Garden" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="xsmall"><i>The advantage of having your garden near the home is clearly shown here</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>The best equipment for storing potatoes in the
cellar consists of long bins divided into compartments
that will hold from one to two bushels;
these bins should have holes bored in the bottom
for ventilation and they should be raised somewhat
from the floor. Never store potatoes directly
on the floor as this is the coldest part of the
cellar and also the dampest; heat rises and cold
falls so what heat there may be in the cellar will
circulate beneath the bins and if, for any reason,
it is necessary to supply artificial heat in the way
of oil-stoves or lamps during a spell of zero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
weather the heat can get under the potatoes and
raise the temperature in the bottom of the bins as
well as on the top.</p>

<p>When the potatoes are in the bins they must
be covered to exclude light and prevent their
turning green. The potatoes should be examined
occasionally during winter to be sure that
none are decaying or being affected by frost. As
a general thing potatoes are not frosted if the
skin crackles when the finger nail is pressed into
it, but slight touches of frost sometimes do not
affect the crispness of the skin but is shown by the
potatoes becoming wet after lying for a while in
a warm room, or by a sweetish taste when cooked.
At that stage they are not injured for food but
are less palatable and are liable to develop a queer
fungus blight in the center. As spring approaches
the potatoes will begin growth at the
eyes-sprout, as it is called, and should be looked
over and all growth rubbed off. This will probably
have to be done more than once as the season
advances.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SWEET POTATOES</p>

<p>Are far more difficult to carry through the
winter than the Irish potatoes. They require
more warmth and a dryer atmosphere, and should
be stored in boxes of dry sand and set on some
support away from the floor. The furnace
cellar, if not too warm is the best place for them
and it is well to use them freely so as to lessen the
loss from decay as much as possible.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">WINTER ONIONS</p>

<p>Should be stored in a dry place, a little above
freezing. Slight frost does not injure onions,
but repeated freezing and thawing does, while
too much heat will start them to growing. An
upstairs room that receives sufficient heat to
keep it from freezing will do nicely and it is a
good plan to use the best onions first so that those
which are unfit for use towards spring will not
be so much of a loss; however, as these onions
make the very best of green onions they are by
no means a total loss, but the small and inferior
ones will do quite as well for this purpose, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
is the live germ only that is important, all the
onion body is formed anew. Where there is a
hanging shelf in a cellar that is dry and warm
the onions can often be wintered there successfully.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">WINTER SQUASH</p>

<p>Require a rather warm and dry situation; the
cellar rarely affords the right conditions for wintering
them successfully. An upstairs room or
garret where a chimney passes through is often
just the thing for them as they may be piled in a
heap near the chimney, with layers of excelsior
or straw between, and protected with blankets or
quilts and so pass the winter in good condition.
From such a storage I have taken perfectly
sound, dry Hubbards in mid-June and March
squash are by no means a rarity.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">BEETS</p>

<p>May be dug any time before the ground
freezes up; the shorter time any vegetable has
to remain in cold storage the better for it, so
if not brought in until about Thanksgiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
delay is all to the good. If the beets are to be
stored in a root cellar covered with earth it is not
material whether they are topped or not. I have
sometimes thought that they kept rather better if
the tops were allowed to remain; certainly there
is, then, no loss from bleeding, and if piled in
heaps with the tops all one way overlapping each
other, but the tops free, it is far easier to find and
remove them when wanted. Slight freezing does
not injure beets if thawed out in cold water, but
severe freezing does, so that sufficient earth should
be used to cover them and the earth may be protected
with blankets if necessary. If no root
cellar is available the beets should be topped and
packed with earth in bins or boxes in the vegetable
cellar. If necessary to store in furnace cellar
place as far from the furnace as possible. Where
no other place for storage is available running a
partition across one end or corner of the cellar
will provide a place that will keep most vegetables
in good shape and the expense will be covered
by the saving in stock. The various wall boards
advertised are excellent material with which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
construct these little storage places and any handy
man, or woman, for that matter, can put up something
that will answer the purpose by the aid of
a hammer and saw, a sheet or two of board and
a few pieces of two-by-four to nail to.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CABBAGE</p>

<p>Are best stored in the root cellar, they may be
pulled and stood up in the corner of the cellar
and the roots buried in somewhat damp earth or
they may be cut, the roughest leaves trimmed
and the heads buried in earth, setting them upside
down so that the earth will not work inside the
leaves; handled in this way they should come out
sound and good in spring. Wrapping in newspapers,
where the supply is limited is sometimes
successful, the main thing being to protect from
the air and too great cold and to prevent the
spread of decay which may attack individual
heads.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CAULIFLOWER</p>

<p>May be pulled at the approach of severe
weather, the lower leaves removed and the plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
put root down, buried in soil, in boxes or pens in
the root cellar and will be available for some time,
but do not keep through the winter like cabbage.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CELERY</p>

<p>Should be dug, with the roots intact and placed
roots down in boxes of wet soil or sand in the
dark cellar, packing the plants close together to
exclude air. If the cellar is necessarily light,
the plants should be shaded or a corner of the
cellar may be enclosed to afford protection from
light. A movable partition made from wall
board is a very handy thing to have in the root
cellar as it makes possible the providing of special
conditions as needed.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">PARSNIPS</p>

<p>Although parsnips are better for remaining in
the ground until spring a supply for winter use
should be dug in the fall, topped and buried in
boxes of sand or earth in the cellar. This may
be done in either the root or the kitchen cellar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
as freezing does not injure the parsnip providing
they thaw out in the ground or in water.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">SALSIFY</p>

<p>Requires the same treatment as parsnips&mdash;leaving
the main crop in the ground until spring but
bringing in a supply for winter use. The main
thing in the storing of all root vegetables is to
prevent wilting more than freezing. Vegetables
stored under any conditions, without the protective
covering of earth to exclude air, soon become
soft and wilted and unfit for food.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">TURNIPS</p>

<p>Are especially sensitive to a dry atmosphere
and must always be buried in sand or earth if
they are to retain their crispness and flavor.
They should not be dug until a touch of frost has
sweetened them, then they should be topped, reserving
the tops for the pig or rabbits and the
roots stored as directed.</p>

<span class="small">CANNING THE GARDEN SURPLUS FOR<br />
WINTER USE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> fullest measure of benefit from the garden
has not been obtained unless one has
preserved for future use the more succulent forms
of vegetables that are not susceptible to preservation
through winter in the usual form of cold
storage.</p>

<p>Those early vegetables which are so keen an
incentive to the planting of a garden&mdash;young
beets, spinach greens, string beans, limas, peas, tomatoes
and the like must be preserved in a cooked
form, hermetically sealed from the air to preserve
them from spoiling. This the commercial canners
have done for years and we have been content
to let them do this work for us at a price that
has added materially to the high cost of living,
while our own garden product, often of a far
better quality, has gone to waste. Market gardeners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
who supply the canneries grow vegetables
with a keen eye to their productiveness. If one
vegetable will produce a half or a third more to
an acre than another variety somewhat better, it
is only human to grow that one, but the private
garden is not, as a rule, grown with a sole idea
of profit; it is quality and the enjoyment of the
product that is looked for and only those vegetables
that will produce a high grade product
will be grown.</p>

<p>The home canning of vegetables has been neglected
owing to the uncertainty of results. Occasionally
one found a housekeeper who could
can corn successfully, but the results usually were
unsatisfactory, all this, however, is changed since
the government experts of the Agricultural Department
have, by careful experiments along the
lines of all sorts of vegetable products, worked
out canning schedules that only require careful
following to insure success.</p>

<p>The government bulletins give explicit instructions
as to necessary equipment, method of
handling each separate vegetable and try, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
possible ways, to insure success for the worker.</p>

<p>At first glance the amount of equipment seems
burdensome and some of the requirements unnecessary,
but I have found that it is not safe to
slight any one of them, but that there are short
cuts in the work that materially lessen the labor.
It will not always be convenient to supply oneself
with a canning outfit involving much expense;
especially will this be the case in the small family
where only a moderate amount of canning is to be
done, though the regular canning outfits greatly
simplify and ease up the work. A home-made
outfit will, however, take care of all the surplus
from the small home garden, especially where
there are but two or three cans to be handled at
one time. There are always vegetables that mature
their fruits sparingly&mdash;too many for immediate
use, but not enough to sell. However, in
order that the vines or plants should continue to
bear heavily, all such products as string and lima
beans, tomatoes, green corn and the like should
be gathered as each reaches its most perfect stage.
This often involves some waste unless it can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
utilized in some way and here is where the canning
is effective, as the continual canning of only one
or two cans at a time results in the course of a
summer in a well-filled cupboard that will insure
one against any serious food shortage that may
arise during the winter.</p>

<p>There are five types of canning outfits: <i>Homemade
outfits</i>, constructed of such utensils as wash
boilers, tin pails, milk cans, metal wash tubs and
lard pails. The lard pails are especially usable
and cream pails are excellent where only a few
cans are to be processed at once; even a teakettle
can be made to do duty where only one or two
pint cans are to be cooked. Any metal vessel
that will allow the water to come at least an inch
above the tops of the cans will do.</p>

<p><i>Hot-Water-Bath Commercial Outfits</i> are constructed
usually for outdoor work, with a sterilizing
vat, lifting-trays, firebox, and smokepipe,
combined in one piece. They are light and convenient.
They may be moved about as desired,
even carried to the orchard or garden where apples
and corn are to be canned in quantity, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
are more adapted to clubs and neighborhood cooperative
work than to the needs of a small
family.</p>

<p><i>Water-Seal Outfits</i> consist of a double-walled
bath and cover which projects down into
the water between the outer and inner walls,
thus making three metal walls and two water-jackets
between the sterilizing vat and the outside
of the canner. A high temperature can be
maintained more uniformly than with the hot-water-bath
outfit, since the escape of steam is prevented
and a slight steam pressure is maintained.</p>

<p><i>Steam-Pressure Outfits</i> are made to carry from
five to thirty pounds' pressure and are equipped
with steam-tight sterilizer, lifting crate, thermometer,
or pressure gauge, safety valve and
steam petcock; they are, of course, the most perfect
equipment and economical of labor and fuel.</p>

<p><i>Aluminum Pressure Cookers</i> are combination
outfits for cooking and canning and have the advantage
of being useful all the year around.
They are light in construction, economical of heat
and will carry as high as thirty pounds steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
pressure; they are equipped the same as steam-pressure
outfits.</p>

<p>The purpose of this chapter, however, is not to
go into the methods necessary for caring for large
quantities of vegetables at one time nor the expenditure
of any considerable sum in effecting
the conservation of garden food; rather it is intended
to help the housewife to save, cheaply and
easily, her garden surplus as it accumulates day
by day. Fuller details than are in the scope of
this chapter can be gained through the canning
and food preservation bulletins sent out by the
Department of Agriculture at Washington and
by the various states.</p>

<p>The same general principles pertain to all
fruits and vegetables to be canned, only the time
of processing varying in individual cases.</p>

<p>The vegetables to be canned should always be
perfect of their kind and absolutely fresh; indeed,
it is better to have everything ready for canning
before they are gathered, then dress, sterilize and
blanch and get into the cans as rapidly as possible.
The Cold Pack Process calls for, first, the sterilizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of the product by plunging for five or six
minutes in boiling water. This is best accomplished
by either a wire basket, lined with cheese-cloth,
if the vegetable is small, like peas or string
beans, or alone for such things as tomatoes, peppers
or corn on cob, or by a large piece of cheese-cloth
a yard square at least. After blanching
the vegetables must be plunged at once in cold
water, to set the color and firm the surface. They
are then packed at once in the cans, a teaspoon
of salt added to each quart and the can filled with
boiling water, rubber and top put in place, but
not screwed tight, and the cans placed in the container,
the water of which must come at least an
inch above the top of the cans, and cooked, or
processed, for the time indicated for each product.
Before using the cans they should be sterilized
by boiling, or at least thoroughly heating to obviate
danger of cracking when plunged into the
hot container.</p>

<p>The government directions state quite emphatically
that the cans should be boiled but after
putting up several hundred cans of vegetables of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
all sorts, without this precaution, all of which kept
perfectly, I have come to the conclusion that it
cuts out a lot of unnecessary time and equipment,
for the necessity of having one large container to
sterilize cans, another to sterilize the vegetables,
a kettle of boiling water to fill up the cans, and
the container for processing, entails a large
amount of working space and an unnecessary
amount of fuel. If any short cuts can be
achieved it is certainly that much to the good, so
I have been able to shorten the work so that much
of my own canning has been done on a one-burner
oil stove with one vessel of boiling water for
processing, blanching, sterilizing jars, etc., and
one pail of cold water for blanching and a good,
big table for handling the vegetables. In handling
the work I have everything ready before
gathering the vegetables. For a few pint or
quart cans I use a cream-pail which will hold four
pints or three quarts. In this I have boiling
plenty of water. I place the cans in a pan adding
a little hot water, turning them carefully until
warm through and then fill up and cover. Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the vegetables in the wire basket or cheese-cloth,
dip them in the boiling water the specified time,
plunge into cold water for an instant, take out
cans, one at a time, being careful not to touch the
tops with the hands, place rubbers, first dipped
in the hot water, fill cans with vegetables, with a
teaspoon of salt for the quart size, half a teaspoonful
for pints, fill with the boiling water
from the container, place caps&mdash;which have also
been sterilized&mdash;on, screw down, but not tight and
place in container, being sure that there is abundance
of water, for the long cooking lowers the
water materially and unless there is another kettle
of boiling water available for filling up the water
may go below the top of the can and the result
will be blown out rubbers which will have to be
replaced. This is one of the serious handicaps
of canning by the cold-pack method. The remedy,
however, is simple. Remove the can, remove
the cap and put a fresh rubber in place, replace
the cap and plunge again in the container and
boil for five minutes longer. The changing of the
rubber should be done as quickly as possible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
care should be taken to avoid touching the edge
of the top of the can or the inside of the cap
while doing so. If there is any delay in replacing
the rubber it will be better to boil ten instead of
five minutes.</p>

<p>When the canning is done on the kitchen range
or on a three-burner gas or oil stove it will be
better to fill the cans with water from the teakettle
and to sterilize the cans in a dishpan, allowing
them to heat on the stove until required, but
excellent results will follow the shorter method.
Pint cans are most desirable for such vegetables
as string beans, peas, lima beans and the like&mdash;things
which are used alone and not combined
with other foods as tomatoes and corn. Pint
cans, however, have about disappeared from the
market and even quarts have been at a premium.
And one should take unusual care in cleansing
cans and tops as soon as emptied, and placing
them in a dry place until wanted for another
year's canning. A cellar is not a suitable place
to store cans, it is far too damp and conducive
to mould. If cans are properly cleansed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
dried and the tops adjusted and stored in a dry
upstairs closet they will need far less sterilizing
when required for use.</p>

<p>Often in canning vegetables it will be found
that there is an uneven quantity&mdash;that is, there
will be a quantity of one kind left after filling the
cans, but not enough for another full can; if desired
this can be put in a can and cooked with the
rest for the family dinner, or it may be put away
with the canned goods, for I have found the partially
filled cans keep quite as well as the full ones
and there are often times when the lesser quantity
will be all that is needed for the meal, or it may
be just enough for a salad or to combine with
some other vegetable in a soup or entr&eacute;e.</p>

<p>In placing the cans in the container there must
always be a rack of some sort to keep the cans
from direct contact with the bottom of the vessel.
This should, if possible, be in the form of a wire
rack. The wire trivets to set hot dishes on,
which may be obtained at the ten cent counter of
any department store, are excellent for use in
cream cans; they just fill the bottom and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
they rest on little half-inch feet they allow the
water to circulate freely beneath the cans, which is
very important and failure to provide for which
is sometimes a cause of blown out rubbers. For
canning with large cans&mdash;quarts and two quarts&mdash;the
twenty-five pound lard-cans are excellent.
They are tall enough to insure plenty of water
over the top of the cans and will accommodate
four or five two quart and five or six one quart cans
and seven pints, though some recommend placing
two tiers of pints in the container, but I have
always thought that rather risky. The lard-cans
are very light to handle and the lids fit closely,
retaining the steam. Whenever there is an imperfect
closing of the lid it will be well to place
a towel over the top of the can before adjusting
the lid to insure the retention of the steam. If
this is done the water will not evaporate so
rapidly.</p>

<p>The following schedule of time for processing
vegetables is that suggested by the Department of
Agriculture and is authoritative. In every instance
the time for processing must be counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
from the time the water commences to boil after
the cans are put in the container, and the boiling
must be continuous.</p>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">CANNING DIRECTIONS FOR VEGETABLES</p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>&mdash;The green grasses grown in the
home garden do not, as a rule, can well. They
are too tender and delicate and break down under
the long cooking suggested. It might be well to
experiment with this, cooking only a short time
and if the asparagus keeps two weeks or more,
open a can and test the flavor and if found acceptable
more can be canned. It requires the
tough white asparagus like the Bonvillet or Argenteuil
for canning and those are the kinds used
in commercial canning. Possibly if the green
grasses were cut below the ground as is done with
the French grasses it would stand up better under
cooking. The directions follow.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>&mdash;Gather and clean at once, scraping
off the scales on the sides, and cut to equal
length. It takes about three bunches for a pint
can as they shrink in blanching. Blanch five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
minutes, plunge at once in cold water. Pack in
cans, sliding the stalks in carefully, butts down,
fill with hot water, add one teaspoonful of salt to
a quart, place rubber and cap in position but do
not screw down tight. Place in container as
fast as filled and boil 90 minutes. Remove
and stand can on cap to cool.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>&mdash;Select young beets about an inch and
a quarter in diameter as the small beets retain
their color better than larger ones. About an
inch of the top may be left on. Wash very carefully
but do not break the skin or remove the
tap-root. Blanch four to five minutes, plunge at
once in cold water. Remove skins by slipping
them off with the hand, avoid the use of knife if
possible and pack at once in cans. Fill with
hot water adding one teaspoonful of salt to the
can and place rubber and cap in place, place in
container and boil 90 minutes.</p>

<p><i>Beans, String</i>&mdash;String or hull, blanch in hot
water from five to ten minutes, or cut in half inch
lengths and steam for five minutes&mdash;for small
quantities a wire flour sieve over a teakettle will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
answer admirably&mdash;dip quickly in cold water,
pack in cans. Fill with hot water, adding one
teaspoonful of salt to the quart. Place rubbers
and caps in position, cook for 120 minutes, remove
and invert to cool and test the joint.</p>

<p><i>Beans, Lima</i>&mdash;Shell and plunge in boiling
water for five to ten minutes, plunge immediately
in cold water. Pack at once in cans, handling
very carefully. Put rubbers and cap in position
but not tight. Place in container and cook 180
minutes.</p>

<p><i>Cauliflower</i>&mdash;Lay the heads in salted water
half an hour to free from any insects that may
have lodgment in the head. Break the head
into convenient sized pieces and blanch in boiling
water five minutes, plunge at once into cold
water, pack in cans, fill with boiling water, add
one teaspoonful of salt to the quart and place
rubber and cap in position but not tight, place in
container and cook 60 minutes. This is the government
time but I have found it overcooks the
cauliflower.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>&mdash;This seems to give home canners more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
trouble than any other vegetable. This is probably
caused by delay in the operation. The
canning of corn involves more labor than any
other vegetable and it is difficult for one person
alone to handle it successfully. Two working
together, one cutting the corn from the ear and
the other packing it in the can, will insure a better
result. The corn to be canned should be of the
sweetest variety&mdash;Golden Bantam or Bantam
Evergreen being excellent sorts. It should be
picked at just the right stage&mdash;between the milk
and the dough stage, or when the milk that flows
when the grain is broken with the thumb nail
looks milky and not watery. It is better to do
one can at a time, blanching and dipping in cold
water and packing the corn in the can, allowing
a half inch at the top for the swelling of the corn,
adding a teaspoonful of sugar and one of salt
for every quart and filling with hot water, capping
and placing in the container before going on with
the next canful. The first can put in will not
be injured by the extra cooking. Waterlogged
or soaked corn is an indication of slowness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
packing. If it is desired to can corn on the ear,
blanch, plunge into cold water and pack at once
in cans large enough to hold several ears. The
two quart economy jars are excellent for canning
corn on the ears. Whole corn is a little difficult
to pack economically, but it can be packed closely
if the jar is laid on the side when packing and
the corn slid in, the first row being put in butt
down and the second tip down. Add a tablespoonful
of sugar to each quart can and do not
fill more than one-third full with boiling water.
When the can is filled with water the flavor of
the corn is impaired, and it is more or less water-soaked.
The big Stowell's Evergreen Corn is
beautiful when canned whole; indeed so fine is
its appearance that it is almost worth while to
can it just for its appearance on the shelves of
the fruit cupboard. Dipping the tops of the cans
in paraffin aids in preserving the contents.
When heating for use in winter, place in oven
instead of hot water as this will render it more
dry.</p>

<p><i>Okra</i>&mdash;Gather the pods while still tender, wipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
clean, plunge into boiling water five minutes,
plunge immediately in cold water, remove and
cut into half-inch rings. Pack in can, adding one
teaspoonful of salt to the quart. Fill with boiling
water, place rubber and cap in position,
tighten and put at once in container and cook
120 minutes. Remove, tighten cap and reverse
to cool and test seal.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>&mdash;Should always be freshly gathered,
shell and steam over boiling water for ten minutes,
blanch and pack at once into cans, adding
one teaspoon of salt and one of sugar to each
quart. Put rubber and cap in position, but do
not tighten. Place in container and sterilize 180
minutes. Peas should be very carefully handled.
A cloudy appearance of the water is an indication
of rough handling or broken peas.</p>

<p><i>Tomatoes</i>&mdash;Scald until skin loosens sufficiently
to remove easily, cold dip, empty the seed cavities
and cut in small pieces. Pack at once in
cans, pressing the tomato down full. Add one
teaspoonful of salt to the quart but no water.
Place rubber and cap and put in container and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
cook 22 minutes. Remove, reverse to cool and test
seal. Tomatoes cooked in the open-pan method
so long customary are so satisfactory that it is
scarcely worth while to change the method, unless
one finds the cold-pack way more convenient and
agreeable. If preferred tomatoes may be canned
whole or simply cut in two and the seed cavities
emptied. Smaller or broken tomatoes may be
cooked and passed through a sieve to remove the
seeds and the pur&eacute;e thus formed used to fill in
between the slices in the can; this makes a very
fine product.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to can vegetables that can
be stored successfully in cellar or store rooms;
such products should not deplete the already
scanty store of cans; but in the case of people
living in flats or apartments where there are no
storage facilities squash and pumpkins for pies
may be utilized in this way to advantage.</p>

<p><i>Squash and Pumpkins</i>&mdash;Prepare and cut into
convenient sections, blanch three minutes, cold
dip. Pack closely in hot jars or cans. Fill with
boiling water, add teaspoonful of salt to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
quart. Put rubbers and caps of jars into position
but do not tighten. Put in container and sterilize
120 minutes. Remove, tighten caps and reverse
to cool and test seal.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><i>Soups</i>&mdash;Odds and ends of vegetables that occur
during the summer may be utilized for vegetable
soups. It often happens that tomatoes are
picked by the chickens so that they are unsalable,
but otherwise sound, or they may be spotted in
a way that does not preclude the use of the uninjured
portion; such tomatoes may be used for
canning if the injured portion is carefully removed.
Okra that is getting too large to be
left ungathered, a few string or lima beans, carrots
that are crowded&mdash;anything in the vegetable
line that lends itself to the concoction of a palatable
soup may be utilized and so make the garden
just that much more remunerative. If possible
the amount of tomato should nearly or quite
equal that of the other vegetables combined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
The tomatoes should be scalded, cold dipped, the
seed cavities emptied and the pulp cooked until it
will pass through a wire sieve to free it from the
seeds. The other vegetables should be blanched,
plunged into cold water and put through the meat
chopper and added to the tomato and the cans
filled, but no water added, the juice of the vegetables,
and especially of the tomato, being sufficient.
The following combination makes an excellent
soup: When the cans are opened for use
in winter beef stock to give the proper consistency
should be added, or one bouillon cube to
each portion to be served and sufficient water
may be substituted or a cream soup may be prepared
by using milk and adding rolled crackers.</p>

<p><i>Vegetable Soup</i>&mdash;&frac12; bushel tomatoes, three
stalks of celery or one teaspoonful of celery seed,
one head cabbage, six carrots, three turnips, six
ears corn cut down through each row of kernels
and the kernels sliced off the ear, &frac12; peck string
beans, two quarts shelled lima beans, one dozen
onions, three red peppers, six salsify roots, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
pint of okra pods (sliced) one cup salt, one tablespoon
black pepper.</p>

<p>Prepare tomatoes as suggested above, cut all
the other vegetables fine and add to the tomatoes.
Separate into two parts. To one part add one
cup of rice, cooked till tender, to the remainder
an equal amount of cooked barley. Fill in cans
and process two hours. Soups can scarcely be
cooked too much, as unless the vegetables are
thoroughly softened the product is unsatisfactory.
The cabbage and turnips may be omitted if their
flavor is not liked.</p>

<p>The government bulletins give a number of
formulas for soups and camp rations which are
worth considering when conserving one's garden
supplies, if one already has cans and tops.
(The pint cans are best as the soup is in solid
form and a pint is sufficient for a family, when
reduced with broth, water or milk.) The cost of
the soup per can will not exceed two or three cents
as against ten for the much smaller cans purchased
at the grocery.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sweet Corn Dried</i>&mdash;As corn is more trouble
to can than any of the other vegetables and more
uncertain in its results, many housekeepers prefer
to dry it, and a way that is very highly recommended
is as follows: The corn is gathered
when still in the milk stage, somewhat younger
than for canning. It is necessary for two to
handle the product as it must all be finished in
one operation&mdash;that is, it is a one-day job, and
a rather strenuous and busy one, too. As in
canning, the corn is blanched, plunged in cold
water, the grains scored through the center and
sliced from the cob, care being given that no part
of the cob is included. It is then placed on plates
or tins with a small amount of butter or butter
substitute added&mdash;just enough to prevent the corn
sticking to the plates&mdash;and placed in the oven
and on top of the stove to dry. It must be stirred
almost continuously to prevent burning or sticking.
Only as much corn must be prepared at one
time as can be accommodated on the stove or in
the oven and one person must prepare and cut the
corn while the other stirs and dries it. The dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
corn is then stored in paper bags or paper cartons
until wanted, and is said to be a very delicious
product, much better liked than canned
corn.</p>

<p><i>Bulletins for Drying Fruit and Vegetables</i> are
sent out by the Department of Agriculture on request
and should be very helpful to the housewife.</p>

<span class="small">FALL WORK IN THE GARDEN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">If</span> the garden has been well tended during the
growing season there will not be much rubbish
to clear away and the absence of weeds will
make the harvesting of the winter vegetables a
pleasure. A bright, sunny day is best for digging
all root vegetables, especially potatoes
which should be allowed to lie on the ground until
dry enough for the dirt to shake off, leaving the
tubers clean and sightly.</p>

<p>After frost has killed the vegetables so that no
further good will be derived from them they
should be pulled and piled in a heap to dry and
be burned; especially is this desirable if they have
been infested with any disease or insects during
summer, but if free from any harmful conditions
they should, preferably, be put on the compost
heap to add fertility to the coming season's garden.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>Wire trellises, poles and wires used for the
training of peas, tomatoes, cucumbers and the
like should now be removed and stored away for
next year. All boxes, boards or sash that can
harbor insects or the chrysalids of cabbage or
other worms, should be raised, cleaned and removed.</p>

<p>The winter treatment of the garden will depend
upon conditions that have existed during
summer. If the garden has been free from insects
and disease it will have been a good plan to
sow the entire area to rye for a cover crop
during winter, to be turned under for green
manure in the spring. This protects the ground
from leaching during winter, especially if the
winter should be open, and adds materially to
the fertility of the soil, but if there has been
trouble with insects and disease it will be better
to fall-plough, leaving the ground in furrows so
that as many as possible of the chrysalids and
larv&aelig; of the various plant enemies may be destroyed.</p>

<p>If onion seed has been sown in August for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
early spring onions it will be well to give the beds
a covering of straw or marsh hay at the approach
of cold weather. The rhubarb rows may be
banked with coarse manure from the barnyard
and the asparagus bed may have the tops removed
and the roots protected with manure; this will
hasten the production of shoots in the spring and
make stronger roots.</p>

<p>If there is a bit of land available for early peas
it may be ploughed and the furrows filled with
well-rotted manure, each furrow turned over the
manure in the next and the rows marked with
sticks; in early spring, drills may be opened with
the hand cultivators and the seed for the very
earliest peas sown.</p>

<p>If the lettuce, carrots, beets, salsify, endive,
spinach, parsnips and radishes have proved satisfactory
and any of the annual varieties have been
allowed to go to seed it will be wise to save the seed
for the coming season as the increasing shortage of
seeds makes it more or less problematical whether
a supply may be forthcoming another season.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Lettuce, endive, spinach, Swiss chard, Chinese
cabbage, and radishes seed freely the first year,
beets, carrots, salsify, parsnips and turnips the
second year and the mature vegetables must be
planted in the spring to produce seed. If there
are good roots of carrots and beets, these may be
stored in sand in the cellar and planted out in
the spring when they will bloom and produce
seed. The parsnips and salsify left in the ground
may be dug in the spring and reset where they
are to bloom and a few plants will give sufficient
seed for the home garden. The seed from the
best tomatoes should have been saved, a few
melons, cucumbers and eggplants allowed to
ripen and the finest of the red peppers saved for
seed. The sweetest and driest of the winter
squash should have its seed set aside for the
coming year. Even should there prove to be
an abundance of seed this saving will do no
harm; the raising of seed of biennial vegetables is
interesting and should there be a real scarcity
of seed one will be very thankful of the forethought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
which makes the shortage innocuous as
far as one's own garden is concerned and, besides,
one may do one's little bit by supplying friends
and neighbors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="small">THE ANNUAL GARDEN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">For</span> the busy woman who has but a modicum
of time to spare for the growing of flowers,
but is loath to relinquish entirely their cheerful
presence about the grounds and house, the annual
garden with its wide diversity of color, season and
charm affords the greatest possible returns for
the outlay required. A few packets of seed, most
of which may be purchased for from five to ten
cents, will lay the foundation for sheets and
sheets of bloom and the labor of planting and
caring for them will be less than is required for
perennials.</p>

<p>One great advantage in growing annuals is
that the beds may be freshly prepared each
spring, there is nothing in the way to retard spading&mdash;no
perennial growths to be carefully worked
around, that the roots may not be injured or the
new growth, not yet above ground, be destroyed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
It is all straight ahead work, and the first early
crop of weeds is completely eliminated, grass
eradicated and all is in order for the reception of
the plants which may have been started in flats
in the house or in a hotbed or cold frame or, in the
case of such annuals as do not take kindly to
transplanting, in the open ground.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary in the case of annuals that
there should be a regular, formally laid out garden
or permanent beds. A border about the
base of the house along the fence or walks, will
give room for several kinds of flowers, flowers
that will be a mass of bloom from early summer
until late frost.</p>

<p>A very satisfactory place for annuals I have
found is down through the vegetable garden. I
like their company while I am at work among the
useful but less ornamental vegetables, so always
plan to have a row of something mid-way of the
garden; usually the row takes the form of tea
roses which never do so well for me as in this
homely situation. The culture is more thorough
than can be given to plants in beds, there is less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
crowding, hence fewer insect pests and I always
plan to have the adjacent vegetables of as ornamental
a character as possible; a fine row of mossy
parsley on one side, feathery carrots on the opposite
row gives a charming background of green.
Lettuce, beets, parsnips, any of the pleasantly
leaved greens are attractive companion rows and
although the rose is the aristocrat of the garden,
objecting decidedly to sharing her bed with
less royal plants I have never found that she objects
to their presence when they keep to their
own allotted row.</p>

<p>This long row through the garden is an excellent
place to start seeds of hardy perennials
for transplanting into permanent beds the following
year, but only for this preliminary growth,
for the annual plowing makes their permanent
tenancy impracticable, but bedding plants such as
dahlias, gladioli, tigridias and the like will be
at their best here and in their summer culture
have all the characteristics of annuals.</p>

<p>For early blooming it is always worth while
to sow the seeds of annuals early in the spring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
flats in the house or in a hotbed or cold frame.
Usually one can spare room in the hotbed for a
few plats of seeds and these should be sown at
the same time the seeds of the vegetables are sown,
sowing each separate variety in little plats by
itself, separating the plats from each other by
narrow strips of wood pressed into the ground,
and labelling each plat with the names of seed,
date of sowing and, if known, the length of time
it takes for the seed to germinate. Annuals,
however, germinate more rapidly than perennials,
many appearing above ground in from three to
five days after sowing, though a few, like the
Arctotis Grandis, nicotianas and ricinus, may
take from ten to fifteen days. This is where the
forethought of labelling the seed plats with date
of sowing and period of germination is of practical
value&mdash;it prevents undue impatience and
discouragement when the plants fail to appear
as soon as we expect them to; but with a mixed
planting of seeds of varying characteristics, there
will always be early comers to encourage one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
keep alive faith in the ultimate appearance of the
least and last.</p>

<p>Any considerable planting of annuals should
include those that will give a long season of bloom
for scenic effect, those that will be especially desirable
for cut flowers and above all those special
flowers which most appeal to our sentiment and
are dear to us through associations or suggestions.</p>

<p>For mass planting about the base of buildings
or in front of shrubbery there are few plants more
effective than the celosias, especially the varieties
known as prince's feather; many of the varieties
in red and yellow effects are very good and they
seem to stand the heat and drought and even the
early frosts remarkably well. Usually a spray
of the plumey blooms is a whole bouquet in itself.
If cut before killing frosts and brought into the
house they will retain their freshness for a long
time, and potted make excellent fall and early
winter plants.</p>

<p>The argemone or prickly poppy is a little
known plant of rather recent introduction that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
is rather slow in getting started in spring, but
once on its way produces a continuous succession
of large poppy-like blooms in golden yellow, pale
yellow and pure white, the latter especially attractive
with its crown of golden stamens. Its
chief merit, however, consists in its immunity to
frost, continuing in full bloom well into November&mdash;a
quality shared by few annual flowers. Perhaps
as close a companion as can be cited is the
tall-growing lupine, a beautiful annual that comes
in purest white, rosy mauve, sky blue, purple
and scarlet and white and mind not at all the
frost of late October and early November. The
soft foliage would seem ill suited to cold, but
if one looks closely one will notice that the foliage
is dry, not succulent like many annuals that
succumb readily to the first cold wave. Balsams
and portulacca are notable examples of this susceptibility.</p>

<p>The nicotianas are other cold-resisting plants
and have the added advantage of self-sowing&mdash;not
to a troublesome extent but sufficiently to insure
a yearly supply of volunteer plants without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
thought or trouble on the gardener's part. The
nicotiana does not open up well in bright sunshine,
but unfolds its snowy cups in late afternoon
and on cloudy days, but in shady positions
is more generous of its beauty and is lovely when
silhouetted against the flaming red of the salvias.</p>

<p>The arctotis grandis is another of the less
commonly grown annuals that should be included
in one's garden planting. These, too, are sturdy
defiers of the frost and exceedingly desirable as
cut flowers, remaining in bloom for a week or
ten days and should be placed in a sunny position
for best effect as they are real sun lovers. Like
all the preceding they are of the easiest culture&mdash;good
garden soil, water if the season is unusually
dry, and plenty of room to develop. The distance
at which any plant should be set depends,
of course, upon its manner of growth, but it is an
excellent rule to plant all erect growing plants
at least half their height apart. Low-growing
and trailing plants, of course, are an exception to
the rule, many requiring two or three times their
height in inches apart, as the verbena.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>Few annuals require staking, notable exceptions
being the sultanas, tall anterrhinums, scabiosas,
the tall stocks and a few others. When
staking is necessary it should be done by as inconspicuous
means as possible; bamboo stakes
painted green are the neatest and most inconspicuous.</p>

<p>For masses of brilliant color there is nothing
to equal the scarlet verbena, the scarlet sage, salvia
splendens, the various phlox Drummondii or
the dwarf nasturtium, the scarlet or orange zinnias
and the marigold, and for sweetness one must
have the sweet peas and the stock.</p>

<p>Much is gained by the use of low-growing
plants as a border to beds of taller plants. Blue
lobelias, dwarf morning glories, English daisies,
sweet alyssum, candytuft, all require little root
room and add materially to the resulting bloom.</p>

<p>For a screen to mask an undesirable view or
object there are several very desirable annuals
that are of the easiest culture and of most effective
presence. With the stately ricinus all are familiar;
less well-known is the tall cleom pungens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
with its curious flowers of pure white and white
and rose, the long, curving anthers of which have
given it the name of "Spider Flower." It is a
beautiful and desirable plant, and should be
started in the house or hotbed and transplanted
where it is to bloom when the nights are warm,
setting the plants two feet apart. The Nicotiana
Sylvestris is another stately plant, growing to a
height of five or six feet in good soil and, unlike
N. affinnis, its snow-white blooms remain open
all day and are attractive when grown in the rear
of beds of salvias. Like the cleom it requires
room to develop. Practically all annuals may
be sown in the open ground; the only object in
sowing in hotbeds or house and transplanting
is to bring them forward early so as to have the
longest possible season of bloom.</p>

<p>To speak of asters seems superfluous, as whatever
flowers may be absent from the annual garden
it is a safe venture to claim that the aster will
not be missing; that is quite as it should be;
there is really no one flower that so completely
meets the requirements of scenic effect and cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
flower work as the asters. In the stronger colors
of crimson, purple and blue it is as effective a
flower as one could wish to use for mass planting,
while for more refined and delicate beauty no one
could ask for anything better than the pure white
and delicate shell pinks of the Ostrich Feather
and Late Branching whites. The Comet asters
are very artistic, attractive flowers but, unfortunately,
do not stand up under wet weather&mdash;a
hard rain reducing them to a dismal, raggy condition.
Set the wide branching asters at least a
foot apart and see that all asters have clean,
healthy soil to grow in to avoid the troubles that
arise when conditions are unfavorable. A warm,
fibrous loam, well enriched with old manure, is
best and water should be given freely during dry
weather, especially when the buds are forming.
The black aster beetle is the only serious foe of
the aster and makes its appearance when the
flowers are in full bloom, doing an immense
amount of damage in a few hours if not destroyed
as they eat the petals of the flowers, rendering
them very unsightly. The only satisfactory remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
is hand picking in early morning while the
beetles are sluggish. If a pan of hot water or
water with a little kerosene in it is carried and the
beetles dropped into it as gathered it will not be
difficult to control them. Spraying with arsenate
of lead will kill them if one does not object to the
use of poisons on flowers that are to be brought
into the house. Paris green can also be used but
discolors the flowers, but hand picking has no objectionable
features aside from the labor entailed,
and that is by no means prohibitive as it takes but
a short time to go over a hundred plants.</p>

<p>Try planting a few salvias on the shady side of
the house; they will not make as much show during
the summer as those grown in the sunlight but
will be in full bloom long after those in exposed
positions are cut down by frost.</p>

<p>A few very desirable annuals are plants of
one florescence and need to have repeated plantings
of seed for a continuous bloom. Most conspicuous
of this class of plants is the candytuft
in white, purple and red and the charming little
schizanthus, which should be sown every few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
weeks for a succession of blooms. The plants
come into bloom in a few weeks from the sowing
of seed and are perfect little pyramids of bloom.
Sow fresh seed of candytuft when the first sown
plants are beginning to form flower buds; used
in this way the candytuft furnishes a most useful
white for window-boxes and vases, and is unexcelled
for edgings of taller plants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="small">THE HARDY GARDEN</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Is</span> a permanent investment, possible only in
the permanent home. It adds dignity and
charm attainable from no other form of planting.
It is to the outdoor life of the home what the
possession of colonial furniture and family heirlooms
is to the indoor life, and yet is neither expensive
nor tedious in its inception. It may be
acquired fully grown, as it were, by an order to
the florist for ready grown plants of blossoming
size, ready to give seasonal bloom, or it may be
developed in a few months, inexpensively and
most interestingly, by procuring the seeds of as
many desirable varieties of hardy perennials as
one has room or inclination for and planting them
in the hotbed in early spring, and transplanting
into permanent positions when large enough or,
better still, by planting the seed in cold frames in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
August or early September and growing them on
until cold weather when they should be protected
for the winter and in the spring planted out where
they are to bloom. Every hardy perennial set
out in one's garden is an asset that will increase
in value each succeeding year. Many have the
root formation that admits of divisions&mdash;as the
Shasta daisy, a single two year old clump usually
dividing up into from six to ten blooming-size
plants. English violets, English daisies, polyanthus,
and many other plants may be divided annually
until in time one owns large colonies of
them, and this is a point well worth understanding,&mdash;that
a large number of one kind of
plant is much more effective and worth while
than a large number of <i>kinds</i> of plants, of just
one or a few individuals. Many plants which
are inconspicuous or ineffective singly or in small
groups, surprise one with their beauty when
grown in large masses or long rows. The
ulmaria&mdash;a variety of spir&aelig;a of deciduous
growth&mdash;is a notable example of this. Planted
singly it is merely a rather pretty flower; grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
in a long row it is a mass of snowy white in late
June and July that compels one with its beauty.
Its congener, the spir&aelig;a fillipendula, a lesser
but most graceful growth, also pleases one especially
when grown in long rows in front of
taller plants. And right here is a point well
worth considering in planting a hardy border&mdash;the
arranging of plants in rising tiers of bloom so
that a bank of bloom may be produced. One
effective bed that gladdened my heart for several
seasons and rose in tier after tier of gracious
bloom through several weeks of early summer had
an initial planting next the front of tritomas,
whose scarlet torches of flame did not come into
bloom until late summer, but from then until
frost made a brilliant band of color. Back of
these was a fine planting of columbine, next a
row of scarlet lychnis alternated with white feverfew,
and still further back a full planting of
the garden spir&aelig;a whose feathery heads of pinky-white
flowers stood four or five feet high and in
turn were topped with fine clumps of physostegias;
the whole planting making a beautiful bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
of bloom and one not commonly seen. This was
a permanent planting requiring little care beyond
the removal of all weeds and grass in the
spring and an occasional thinning out of the
plants when they became too crowded. The
physostegia increases rapidly by root division
and the lychnis, feverfew and aquilegias all self-sow
so the bed practically never ran out or needed
renewing and the cost, except for the tritomas,
was that of a few packets of seeds&mdash;probably
a total of fifty cents for some one hundred and
fifty square feet of loveliness, and there are many,
many combinations as happy and as easily acquired
as that.</p>

<p>Lacking the convenience of hotbeds and cold
frames, the vegetable garden is a most excellent
place in which to start hardy perennials for a permanent
garden. Flowers planted in rows among
vegetables always seem to do better than anywhere
else, the reason being that they are not
crowded&mdash;usually being in single rows with a
foot or more of open space at each side through
which the hoe and cultivator can work freely, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
where they will receive regular and constant attention
throughout the growing season. In a
garden of say fifty feet in width, several varieties
of flowers may be grown in short lengths of ten
feet or more. They should be covered somewhat
more deeply than when sown in the hotbed or
cold frame and the ground firmed well above
them, especially if the weather is dry at the time
of planting; when the seedlings appear they
will probably need thinning in order that they
may not grow spindling, but will not need the
room they will require when in permanent quarters.
Many kinds of hardy perennials will give
some bloom the first year, though, of course, they
will not be at their best, but they will be sufficiently
pronounced to make it possible to select
those most desirable for cultivation. Delphiniums,
for instance, will give small spikes of bloom,
probably a foot high, the first season and if the
Gold Medal Hybrids have been planted some
very lovely blooms will result. In the fall the
plants may be lifted and set in permanent positions,
or they may be left in the ground until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
spring and then transplanted; probably this is the
better treatment providing the ground is not to be
ploughed too early, as some of the perennials die
down in the fall and may not appear above the
ground in time for very early transplanting.</p>

<p>Evergreen boughs make the best winter covering,
especially when rested against some support
with the tips downward, so as to shed rain. They
do not mat down into a sodden mass as do leaves
which have a tendency to smother and rot plants
with an evergreen crown of leaves, but protect
from sun and cold winds, at the same time admitting
sufficient air to the plants to keep them in
good condition.</p>

<p>When immediate effect is desired from hardy
perennials which must be produced from seed,
considerable time may be gained by planting the
seeds in flats in the house in early February, giving
them as light a position as possible, a south
window being preferable, and transplanting the
little seedlings to the hotbed when that is started
in March or early April. This will often force
along the blooms and will certainly produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
strong, well developed plants by fall, plants that
should stand the winter and come out in spring in
fine condition, ready for a notable season of
bloom.</p>

<p>While hardy perennials are generally thought
of in connection with such herbaceous plants as
die down to the ground in fall, reappearing again
in spring, and the few that make a crown of
winter foliage, like the hollyhocks and delphiniums,
no perennial garden could be considered
complete without an abundance of lilies. These
may be planted here and there, singly and in
groups among the perennials and shrubbery and
will need little attention, increasing in numbers
year by year. This is especially true of the
candidum or annunciation lily, which once
planted continues to increase for many years, but
should have the clumps broken up once in three
or four years and spread out to give more room.
Failure to bloom successfully always calls for investigation
of the condition of the bulbs. Usually
it will be found that decay has set in or that
worms or ants have invaded the bulbs. In either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
case the bulbs should be lifted and cleaned and
all diseased scales removed, saving the scales
for replanting; reset in clean soil, packing a
handful of clean, sharp sand and a pinch of charcoal
about each bulb. Candidum lilies should
not be set more than an inch or two below the
surface of the ground, but most other lilies, especially
the auratums, speciosums, Brownii, and
giganteums should be planted six or more inches
deep and well padded with sand. A little pad
of sphagnum moss under each bulb is excellent as
it supplies the necessary drainage. Auratum
bulbs and bulbs of the Japanese lilies are not as
permanent as the candidums and tiger lilies,
usually lasting a maximum of five years, if left
undisturbed.</p>

<p>It is not much use to plant lily bulbs, tulips
and hyacinths in ground infested with moles.
The moles should first be eradicated, and then
bulbs may be planted safely but it is little satisfaction
to make an extensive and costly planting
of bulbs only to have them become food for the
moles and ground mice. I have known plantings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
of several hundred tulips to be entirely destroyed
during a single winter. In one such planting
of five hundred bulbs only three appeared above
ground the following year. A good mole trap
is invaluable where moles are in evidence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="small">THE PLANTING OF FALL BULBS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> time for planting of hardy perennials
and shrubbery is optional with the gardener,
many things doing quite as well when
planted at one season as at another, but in the
planting of spring blooming bulbs less latitude
exists; these must be gotten into the ground in
fall if any measure of success is desired. The
handling of this class of plants is one of the luxuries
of gardening, as they come all ready to commence
root growth, but in a perfect dormant condition,
and may be gotten into the ground very
much at one's convenience, and regardless of
weather; the earlier they are planted the stronger
root growth they will be able to make before the
ground freezes, which makes for stronger bloom
in the spring.</p>

<p>Crocus, scillas, narcissi, daffodils, tulips, hyacinths
and the like may be planted from the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
they can be procured from the florist (which
is usually in September) until the ground freezes.
They will grow and bloom to perfection in any
good, well-drained garden soil, providing it is
not infested by moles and ground mice but beware
of these, as they seem to possess an insatiable appetite
for bulbs and once they have entered a bed
will seldom leave it until they have exhausted its
resources.</p>

<p>I recall that a few years ago I planted, in an
empty canna bed on the front lawn, some five
hundred choice, named tulips. The following
spring just three tulip plants appeared above
ground&mdash;the moles having destroyed the other
four hundred and ninety-seven. In the flower
garden where other hundreds of bulbs had been
used to border beds of hardy perennials, they
fared somewhat better, the greater part coming
up, but many had been destroyed and still others
carried far from the place of their planting, coming
up as much as three feet away in the middle
of paths and in sod.</p>

<p>One of the most satisfactory ways of using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
tulips is to plant them as a border to beds of perennials
or shrubs, setting them in single, double
or triple rows, along the edge and leaving them
to ripen and increase from year to year; in this
way one gets the greatest good at the least expenditure
of time and space. When they are
planted in beds by themselves it is customary to
lift them when through blooming and to heel
them in some out-of-the-way spot until the tops
have died when they may be lifted and stored in
paper bags until time to plant out again in the
fall. This leaves the beds free for summer annuals
or bedding plants. If it is not desired to
lift them, then one may sow seed of some annual
of light root growth such as the myostis or forget-me-not,
the schizanthus, pansy, verbena, or phlox
Drumondii, as these plants will not interfere with
the maturing of the bulbs and the protection afforded
them from the heat of summer will be of
benefit.</p>

<p>The soil for any variety of bulbs should be rich,
mellow and thoroughly well drained and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
better in planting any but the smallest bulbs to
remove a few inches of the top soil and having
leveled off the surface mark it in straight lines
from side to side each way so that the lines cross
each other and set a bulb at each intersection of
the lines. For tulips the lines should be five
inches apart each way and for hyacinths seven
inches. Where solid beds of hyacinths or tulips
are planted small bulbs, such as crocus, scilla
or winter aconite, may be used for filling in
the spaces between with charming effect. White
crocus and blue scillas are especially dainty, or
the lovely ixias may be used but in this case the
beds must be very carefully protected against the
cold and covering removed with discretion in the
spring.</p>

<p>Narcissus, daffodils, jonquils and all that family
appear to better advantage when planted in
long double or triple rows and should be set a
foot apart each way and about four inches deep.
These bulbs increase by forming new bulbs in a
circle around the old bulb and should be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
abundant room to increase and once planted
should not be disturbed until they have become
too crowded to bloom well.</p>

<p>Crocuses are never so lovely as when studding
the green of the lawn in early spring and this is
the simplest form of planting, it only being
necessary to lift a bit of sod with a trowel, slip
a crocus bulb underneath and press the sod back
above it. Plant them informally, singly, in
groups. Scatter them freely about with the hand
and bury them where they fall. There is one
precaution, however, to be observed in this system
of planting&mdash;the lawn-mower must be withheld
in spring until the crocuses have matured their
leaves or there will be no flowers the following
spring.</p>

<p>All spring bulbs profit by a liberal application
of <i>old, well-rotted</i> manure but this should be
either spaded deep in the beds below where the
bulbs will set or used as a top dressing after the
soil removed before planting has been replaced
and not allowed to come in contact with the
bulbs. Manure is not only harmful in itself but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
it is also the home of the little white wire worms
so injurious to all bulbs and especially to lilies,
and almost always when bulbs are found to be
not doing well the trouble will prove to be either
worms or poor drainage.</p>

<p>A part of the winter covering of all bulb beds
should be lifted as soon as growth starts in the
spring as a stockier, stronger growth results but
the finer portion should be left and in case of such
tender bulbs as ixias that removed may be kept
handy to replace in case of an unusually cold
snap.</p>

<p>Many of the miscellaneous bulbs offered by the
florists are desirable when grown in well established
groups, but lack effect planted singly or
in too small groups. One of the loveliest of summer-blooming
bulbs is found in the anthericum
or St. Bruno's lily. These should be set in
colonies in the hardy border where they may
remain undisturbed for years. Plant about
three inches deep and four inches apart. Alliums,
chinodoxia, and bulbs of this class need
grouping to be at their best, otherwise they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
apt to appear rather straggly. I like to see bulbs
colonized among the shrubbery and the edge of
evergreens where they appear at their best in
the early days of spring and do not seriously interfere
with the use of the lawn-mower later on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="small">ECONOMY IN THE PURCHASE OF SHRUBBERY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">May</span> often be achieved by a wise selection
of varieties. Any extensive planting
runs up into dollars fast, especially if the larger
sized shrubs are selected. Fortunately successful
planting depends as much upon a number of
plants of one variety as upon the size and distinction
of the sorts. A dozen plants of one
variety of spir&aelig;a, for instance, is far more effective
than one plant each of twelve varieties&mdash;try
it and see if I am not right.</p>

<p>If, therefore, one has several strips of lawn to
embellish with shrubbery and wishes to economize
the expenditure as far as possible it will
be found a most excellent plan to make a mixed
planting on the most urgent section, selecting
those shrubs which by their manner of root formation
offer possibilities of rapid increase and use
the product for subsequent planting; taking all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
of the sort of plant so as to leave as few varieties
in the old bed as possible and in this way simplifying
the ultimate planting of the entire grounds.</p>

<p>When these new offspring have reached a
presentable size they may be retained and the
other sorts which can now be spared may be
removed to a new location, planting out the
youngsters in their vacated positions.</p>

<p>There are three classes of plants which lend
themselves very readily to propagation through
root division, layering and root offshoots. The
first is found in those plants which make an exuberant
root system of many fine feeding roots
and many stems. A good example of this class
is found in the Hydrangea arborescens which may
be lifted, pulled apart and the several plants reset
without in any way disturbing its growth intention.
In this respect it differs materially
from H. paniculata which, while making a generous
root system, has but the one main stem and
so is incapable of division but is easily propagated
by cuttings thrust into the ground in the shade of
the plant early in June. H. arborescens is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
similar in habit to many perennials which are
increased by root division, as for instance the
Shasta daisy, English daisy, English violets,
polyanthus and others.</p>

<p>Often a plant of H. arborescens purchased
from the florist will admit of the removal of two
or three smaller parts without seriously injuring
the appearance of the original plant and if these
are set out and well cared for they will quickly
develop into blossoming plants for this form is
an early and reliable bloomer.</p>

<p>Spir&aelig;a Anthony Waterer is another shrub
which may be increased by pulling apart the
roots; indeed this plant is benefited by occasional
treatment of this sort, doing much better and
flowering more freely. Planted in front of taller
shrubs it is a very desirable and reliable plant and
if the faded flowers are removed after the spring
florescence it will continue to produce flowers
throughout the summer.</p>

<p>One of the most easily propagated shrubs is
found in the symphoricarpus or snow-berry; indeed,
in the case of this pretty shrub the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
is not to increase one's stock as the new growth is
usually prostrate the first year, lying supinely
on the ground and if left undisturbed will throw
out roots at the joints and rapidly produce attractive
little plants as robust as the parent stock.
Lifting the branches occasionally will prevent
rooting but usually one likes to have the new
plants form. I do. After becoming well rooted
the branch should be severed between the plant
and the parent. As the root growth is dense,
consisting of a mass of fibrous roots, the young
plants can be lifted at almost any time and reset
without much check to growth. The pale, pinky-white
flowers come in mid-summer, followed by
the white berries which remain on the bushes well
into the winter and are very attractive.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar in its way of increase is the
Deutzia-Pride of Rochester. That magnificent
shrub which challenges our admiration when covered
with its drooping, bell-shaped white flowers
late in June and which, under favorable conditions,
assumes the proportions of a small tree.
Like the symphoricarpus the lateral branches are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
more or less inclined to a recumbent or prostrate
habit or because of their flexibility are easily
pegged down and root easily at the joint but do
not make as vigorous root growth and the joint
should have a little earth drawn over it and be
kept moist by placing a stone on top. This shrub
is so altogether desirable that several branches
may well be devoted to the increase of stock, one
or more plants being produced from each branch.</p>

<p>Of those shrubs which throw up suckers from
the roots the lilac will occur to most people as a
well-known example, so if in buying the newer,
double-flowered sorts one will insist on purchasing
plants upon their own roots and not be satisfied
with grafted plants one will soon become possessed
of a quite respectable planting of lilacs
of notable size and color of bloom. The suckers
should be removed as soon as they have had one
season of growth for the protection of the parent
plant which will be much depleted in bloom by
their permanent presence.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful foliage shrubs, the
fern-leaved sumac&mdash;Rhus typhina laciniata&mdash;forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
root rhizomes which send up volunteer
plants at each joint. These should be removed
and replanted. This is one of the most beautiful
ornamentals with which I am acquainted,
quite rivalling the Japanese maples. The leaves
are compound or pinnate, fifteen to eighteen
inches long and of a dark, rich green on the upper
side, glaucous beneath and with a rich red midrib&mdash;an
elegant fern-like spray which is very useful
in cut flower work and in autumn turns to the
most vivid crimson imaginable. It does best
when protected from severe wind, from which it
seems to shrink, distorting its symmetrical
growth. In good rich soil a half dozen offshoots
may appear the second year after planting and
after one has once become familiar with its beauty
all will be welcome.</p>

<p>Another small tree or shrub with similar characteristics
is the Aralia spinosa or Hercules' club
as it is commonly called. This also has the compound
leaves somewhat resembling the black
walnut but of gigantic proportions, two to
three feet in length and of equal breadth, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the tree a most tropical effect. It is very easily
transplanted and a few trees in a clump are very
effective or it is fine as a specimen tree and owing
to its abundance of spines can be utilized effectively
as a hedge. Where only a single tree is
wanted it is easily kept in check by cutting out
the rhizomes with a spade close to the parent
plant.</p>

<p>The euonymus, or burning bush as the Indians
always called it, propagates itself by means
of its coral berries which appear in quantities in
late summer or early fall. One finds the volunteer
plants appearing every spring in places
where one least expects them and one can lift and
transplant them wherever desired.</p>

<p>Another most attractive shrub which may be
easily raised from seed sown in spring is the
Buddleya&mdash;a plant with long racemes&mdash;in the
newer form of B. veitchiaa, over twenty inches
long, of violet mauve flowers of a delightful violet
fragrance. Spring-sown seed will often produce
blossoming plants the first season which in the
second will attain a height of from three to five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
feet and be a perfect bouquet of bloom throughout
the summer. The branches are somewhat
pendulous and in the young state are better for a
little support. They afford delightful material
for cut-flower work and the odor has that fugitive
elusive quality of the violet, seeming to come
from different directions and to elude one's
search.</p>

<p>It will be found an excellent plant to combine
with Spir&aelig;a Van Hutti as it comes into bloom
after that splendid plant has rested on its laurels
for the summer and keeps the hedgerow alive
with bloom and fragrance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="small">A CONTINUOUS SUCCESSION OF BLOOM IN<br />
THE SHRUBBERY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="in0 bold center p2t">HOW TO SECURE IT</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> planting of shrubbery about the home
is so important that it may well take
precedence of the flower garden proper or even
the grading of the lawn itself. Indeed, if one
owns the site of a home and the building is yet
in the future, no better expenditure of one's spare
time and dollars can be inaugurated than such
initial planting as shall insure the presence of
blooming shrubs about the home at the time of
its completion so that all may be beautiful and
perfect together, rather than that two or three
years must elapse before one can begin to enjoy
the results.</p>

<p>Hardy shrubs vary very greatly in the precociousness
of their bloom, certain forms giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
quite noticeable results the second season, while
others need two or three years' growth even to
indicate what their ultimate beauty will be.</p>

<p>The location, too, will have much to do with results.
For a low planting about the foundation
of the house, in front of porches or to top low terraces
many plants may be employed which would
be unsatisfactory in places at a distance where
a general effect is desired more than an intimate
relation. For masking a building, hiding an undesirable
view and the like, tall-growing shrubs
and flowering trees are usually preferred and
these being of more or less slow growth require
time to develop.</p>

<p>In all shrubbery planting it will be found that
a number of plants of one sort is far more effective
than one or two plants each of many distinct
kinds. The mistake is often made of planting
only shrubs which bloom together, producing
a medley of more or less inharmonious colors and
form for a few weeks in spring leaving the shrubbery
bare and uninteresting for the remainder of
the year. This is a mistake I have often made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
in my own garden, but one which I usually rectify
by planting in other shrubs which will come
forward when the first have ceased to bloom.</p>

<p>For a number of years a very beautiful hedge
of Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora has separated
the lawn from the flower garden; only one
objection could be urged against it&mdash;its flowerless
condition throughout most of the summer.
To overcome this objection, scarlet salvias were
alternated between the plants and an edging of
scarlet and white phlox made a mass of color from
mid-June until well into October. This, of
course, was not legitimate shrubbery planting,
so recourse was made to alternating Hydrangea
arborescens with the paniculata. These coming
into bloom late in June gave a very satisfactory
arrangement, but this year Deutzia-Pride of
Rochester, which also blooms in June, was introduced
and I am anticipating much pleasure from
the addition.</p>

<p>A hedge of Spir&aelig;a Van Hutti extending from
the house to the road is very beautiful in early
May, but inconspicuous and uninteresting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
remainder of the summer. If it had been in a
situation demanding a heavier planting I should
have alternated the plants, setting them behind
the spir&aelig;as, with forsythias&mdash;whose golden yellow
blooms make bright the garden in earliest
spring&mdash;and between the forsythias introduced
the deutzias.</p>

<p>There are few more satisfactory and graceful
plants for use in front of a porch than this Spir&aelig;a
Van Hutti; its gracefully curved branches,
though growing to a good length, curve away
gracefully from the building, bending with their
weight of snowy bloom almost to the ground and
the growth is very strong and rapid, but never
coarse. It is the very best early blooming shrub
to date.</p>

<p>Very lovely effects may be secured by alternating
the spir&aelig;a with the Weigela Eve Rathke,
and keeping this down to a somewhat prostrate
habit; this will give a perfect sheet of bloom from
early May until the last of June and a less-pronounced
show of flowers throughout the remainder
of summer from the weigela.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>There is a strong tendency when purchasing
shrubbery to select a little of everything&mdash;one
plant of each, perhaps. I do this myself&mdash;not
without excuse perhaps on my part, for we people
who write for the benefit of others have to get
our knowledge by, often costly, experience, and
not by the mere reading of nursery catalogues.
It is sometimes a most excellent thing to gratify
this inclination providing one has a piece of land
which can be devoted to experimental purposes
and where one can shift things about until one
has gained just the right combination and exposure
for each plant. A strip of ground twelve
or fifteen feet wide and as long as available will
give room for a very successful planting of small
trees and shrubs and hardy perennials may be
introduced to fill in until the shrubs have reached
an effective size. Ulmarias, hardy phlox, oriental
poppies, rudbeckias and the like will be
found very useful and tall clumps of lilies should
always be interspersed in all permanent plantings.</p>

<p>It will often be found that some shrub which
one has admired at close range is entirely ineffective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
in the shrubbery border; take, for instance,
the Tartarian honeysuckle&mdash;a pretty
enough thing close at hand but ineffectual and
insignificant at any distance.</p>

<p>For a long shrubbery border of twelve or fifteen
feet wide no better selection of shrubs can be
made than these seven perfectly reliable and
hardy shrubs&mdash;Forsythia, April; Spir&aelig;a Van
Hutti, May; Deutzia Pride of Rochester, June;
Hydrangea arborescens, July, August; Hydrangea
paniculata, September; Althea, October
and November. These are&mdash;with perhaps
the exception of the althea, which is sometimes
uncertain&mdash;absolutely hardy and reliable plants
which increase in size and beauty from year to
year and insure a constant succession of bloom
throughout the summer and fall so that by their
use the shrubbery border need never be without
flowers.</p>

<p>In planting a border of these mixed shrubs attention
to arrangement will have much to do with
success. Of course it will occur to the most inexperienced
that the taller shrubs should be in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
rear, but it is not necessary or desirable that they
should be planted in a rigid, unbroken line. Better
that the line be somewhat waved, dipping forward
occasionally a step or two. Then it will,
of course, occur that the lowest forms will be in
front, but this line, too, maybe broken occasionally
with advantage, allowing the second row to
step forward enough to prevent too much formality
of outline.</p>

<p>Where immediate effect is desired, and this is
invariably the case, either large specimen shrubs
should be used or, if the smaller sorts seem more
available, then these should be set as close again
as would be done in the planting of large specimens
and after they have made two or three
years' growth and have begun to crowd, every
other plant may be lifted and used to start a new
shrubbery elsewhere.</p>

<p>This was what was done with my hydrangea
hedge, started as a border between the front
lawn and a pear orchard. The plants were first
set three feet apart in a single row. When they
had filled up the intervening space they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
lifted and used for a hedge in the rear of the lawn,
this time being set six feet apart, a distance
which they soon closed, and for weeks in the fall
were a wonderful mass of bloom. A hedge of
Spir&aelig;a Van Hutti replaced the hydrangeas in
the front and these will probably remain undisturbed
for a number of years as, owing to the
proximity of a magnificent maple tree, they do
not make the strong growth they do in more favorable
situations.</p>

<p>Although I have suggested the forsythia,
spir&aelig;a, deutzia, hydrangeas and althea, etc., as the
seven very best shrubs for general planting there
are very many more worthy of adoption.
Among these the various weigelas, especially the
red varieties, the syringas and the lilacs should
not be overlooked. Of the latter, far too little
is known, most people being content with a bush
or two of the old-fashioned purple and white of
their grandmothers' garden, and perhaps, as a
truth, these old sorts appeal to our hearts more
strongly than the newer, more showy varieties
and it is in no spirit of disparagement that I urge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the adoption of some of the newer sorts&mdash;not to
displace, but to supplement and extend the lilac
season over a period unknown to the old-time
garden.</p>

<p>Syringa vulgaris, alba and purpurea are
usually through blooming by the twentieth of
May, or thereabouts, but Emodi, with its rosy-white
flowers, is ushered in with the early days of
June and Josikaea shows its first purple blooms
late in the same month about the time that the
creamy-white panticles of Japonica appear.
The new double-flowered, named sorts come into
bloom about the time of the common sorts and
are well worth the extra cost they involve. Mme.
Cassimire Perier and Pres. Grevy are two of the
finest sorts and should be in every collection.</p>

<p>In buying lilacs it will pay well to purchase
those on their own roots. Most of the named
lilacs are grafted on common stock and the
suckers are annoying and worthless and if allowed
to grow will seriously interfere with the blooming
of the graft. Such shoots as come from true
roots can be detached and used to increase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
supply of plants and are, therefore, most valuable
additions.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful small trees for planting
where a light and feathery effect is sought or
against a background of evergreens is found in
the tamarix. I know of nothing so airy and
graceful as these at all times and especially when
in bloom. The flowers, which are very tiny, quite
cover the branches at the time of blooming in
May, in mid-summer and in fall according to their
season and there is a marked difference in the
foliage which in certain species shows a decided
blue tinge which is very beautiful. Unfortunately
they are not always entirely hardy at the north
and require a somewhat protected position.
They are very useful at the seashore, being one
of the few things which can stand the salt air.
As they make a rapid growth one can afford to
experiment with them until just the right environment
is found for they are well worth trying
for and planted in groups of the different sorts
will give a succession of bloom all summer. They
are very useful for cut-flower work, making exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
bouquets when placed in dull green
majolica or similar holders.</p>

<p>Very careful preparation of the ground for
shrubbery is essential as once planted they
usually remain undisturbed for years; for this
reason the earth should be dug very deep, underdrained,
if necessary, and thoroughly fertilized.</p>

<p>After planting the ground should be kept cultivated
by hoeing or by the use of the scuffle-hoe&mdash;anything
which will maintain a dust-mulch, prevent
the earth drying out and caking and retain
the moisture. The success of the planting depends
upon this one feature more than upon any
other one thing. A plant insufficiently supplied
with moisture during the growing season is quite
certain to succumb to the rigors of the succeeding
winter&mdash;not, indeed, on account of the cold itself,
but the condition in which it entered the winter.</p>

<p>The best season for the planting of all hardy
shrubs is early spring, before growth starts, the
next best, late fall after the foliage has dropped.
Altheas and white birch trees, however, do better
with spring planting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="small">GARDENING FOR SHUT-INS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> are possibilities in the indoor culture
of flowers, though it may seem to the
casual observer, that only open air culture would
justify one in undertaking the growing of a
flower garden on any extended scale; but open
air gardening, while it certainly makes for unlimited
area of flower beds and a great variety
of sorts has still its drawbacks of inclement
weather, insufficient or too much moisture, much
humbling of one's physical self on bended knees
and a summer-long fight with the myriad insect
pests, from the tiny aphis that colonizes itself on
the tip of every green shoot in early spring, to
the predatory mole that furrows up paths and
beds, making efficient drains to deflect all water
intended for the refreshment of the plants.</p>

<p>Such indoor plants as one may elect to grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
are assured an adequate and continuous supply
of moisture, a soft and friable soil, a reasonable
freedom from insect pests and a certain amount
of protection from burning sun and drying winds.
Moreover they are not restricted in their season
of bloom to a few months of the year; the indoor
garden may be in bloom the year around&mdash;a bewitching
succession of most of the seasons repertoire
of bloom.</p>

<p>The indoor garden may have its beginning in
the late days of September, when the hardy
spring blooming bulbs come into the market.
Nearly all of this class of plants force readily and
pots and window boxes may be filled with soil,
planted to tulips, hyacinths, narcissi, valley
lilies, and the like and set aside in a cool dark
cellar for midwinter blooming, requiring no further
care for weeks to come. In the meantime
their places need not be kept empty waiting their
time of bloom but boxes and pots of bright geraniums,
cinnerarias, primroses, cyclamen and the
like will keep bright every nook and corner one
can spare. Nothing is more dainty and delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
than a window full of primroses, and no plant
will give a more generous and constant succession
of bloom from fall until spring.</p>

<p>As far as practicable, the growing of plants
in window-boxes instead of pots will be found
more satisfactory. Inside boxes which are narrow
enough to rest on the window-sill are preferable
and the plants may be planted directly in the
boxes or, if preferred, in pots and the pots
plunged into the boxes with moss packed between
the pots to retain the moisture. This gives a
better moisture condition than when the pots
are stood on a shelf, exposed on all sides to the
drying air of the living-room. It has the added
advantage of allowing the pots to be lifted from
the box for spraying the foliage, a great help
to successful growth, and to apply such insecticides
as may occasionally be needed. Plants
grown in the dry air of the living-room are apt
to be affected by red spider; this is especially noticeable
with such plants as cinnerarias, calceolarias
and a few others. Those who are so fortunate
as to possess that modern essential of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
well equipped house&mdash;a sun room&mdash;will find
limitless opportunities for floriculture, boxes beneath
the windows, trellises against the walls and
hanging baskets, all affording opportunity for
much delightful work with flowers.</p>

<p>One of the most fascinating features of indoor
gardening is found in the growing of greenhouse
and other flowers from seed, and this is a feature
especially suited to the invalid or shut in. The
little flats in which seed is started are so light and
easily handled and the plants grown from seed
so sure to do well that one may depend almost
entirely on plants from this source. Almost any
light, shallow box may be used, as flat, half size
cigar boxes, codfish boxes, or boxes specially
constructed to fit the window-sills and divided
by strips of wood into several compartments may
be used. All require the same treatment&mdash;a
few holes to insure drainage, a fine mellow soil
of fibrous loam, leaf mold and a little sharp sand,
filled to within a half inch of the top of the box
and well shaken down, and the best seed procurable.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>All begonias, rex, fibrous and tuberous may be
readily grown from seed which should be lightly
scattered over the surface of the soil, and pressed
down with a bit of smooth board, then set in a
pan of water till the surface looks dark, surplus
water drained away, covered with white paper,
glass and set in a warm place till the tiny plants
break through the soil, when they should be given
air and light gradually and encouraged to make
a healthy, sturdy growth from the start.</p>

<p>A low, broad table with a large, shallow drawer
and a shelf half way down one side will be found
the most convenient place to work and this can
be moved as the work progresses from place to
place so as to make as little walking and lifting
as possible. Another work-table that I have
found most convenient consists of a broad
shelf&mdash;hinged to a strip of wood nailed to the
window-casing, as wide as the window-casing
and deep enough to reach the floor when dropped
down out of use. This is held in place by two
strips of metal attached to the window-casing that
hook over screw-heads in the side of the shelf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
but drop down against the wall when not in use.
Such a shelf affords an excellent working surface
for starting seeds in flats, bulbs and cuttings in
pots and is indispensable for drawing plants
away from a window on stormy nights. If finished
to match the woodwork of the room it will
be an attractive feature whether in use or dropped
down out of the way and may be used for papers
and magazines when not required for plants.
For the latter purpose a neat finish is a border
to match the standing woodwork and a center of
green baize of felt.</p>

<p>There are a number of attractive vines and
trailing plants&mdash;the Asparagus Sprengeri, Manettia
Vine, Thumbergia&mdash;that may be grown
successfully from seed and add greatly to the interest
of the indoor garden.</p>

<p>At this time of the year it will be worth while
to start seeds of certain garden annuals for use
in outside window-boxes. Nasturtiums, verbenas,
candytuft, phlox Drummondii, petunias,
coleus, ageratums, daisies, lobelias, all make
bright and charming window gardens and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
the sliding screens are used that may be pushed
up out of the way, the boxes may be planted and
cared for from the inside with little fatigue.</p>

<p>Hanging baskets add much to the charm of
sun room and porch, but are difficult to care for
as usually arranged, but if instead of hanging
from a short chain from a hook in the ceiling or
cornice of porch or sun room, the basket is attached
to a stout cord passed over a pulley and
the free end provided with a couple of rings to
hook over hooks in the side wall or pillars to hold
it at the desired height it can be lowered on to a
table for attention with little trouble. The moss-lined
wire baskets are the best for this purpose;
they retain moisture and are free from danger of
breakage. If a pail of water is placed on the
table beneath them and the basket lowered into
this and allowed to remain until the soil is thoroughly
soaked, then raised sufficiently by one of
the rings to drain away all surplus water, the
plants will be in the best possible condition to
grow and bloom.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most fascinating plants for growing
indoors is the little Japanese rosebushes,
which may be grown from seeds into blooming
plants in from six to eight weeks. They make
the daintiest, most charming little plants imaginable.
Shapely, many branched and loaded with
bloom they are the very daintiest "Favors"
imaginable for luncheons and other social affairs
and are charming gifts at all times. The blossoms
are about the size of a ten cent piece, and
come in white, pink and red. The seeds may be
sown in the pots&mdash;three inch ones, in which they
are to bloom or may be sown in flats and pricked
out into pots when large enough. I have found
the seed to germinate very freely and the plants
to grow on finely from the start. When planted
in pots these should be plunged in a shallow box
of wet sand or moss in a sunny window. This is
the way to handle all young greenhouse plants,
especially cyclamen, cinnerarias, gloxinias, carnations,
Lady Washington geraniums and the
like. To keep them growing vigorously they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
should not be allowed to dry out, nor to become
soggy with too much water.</p>

<p>For starting summer-blooming bulbs the use
of moss in shallow boxes or baskets will be found
more convenient than the heavier soil. The
sphagnum moss used by florists for shipping
plants is the sort needed and may be used again
and again if necessary, the only merit it has being
its retention of moisture, exclusion of air and
lightness for handling.</p>

<p>If one wishes to grow from seed for outdoor
planting the hardier annuals and perennials, then
somewhat larger and deeper flats should be used,
but none over four inches in depth should be undertaken.
In these such readily salable plants
as asters, salvias, balsams, cob&aelig;a scandens,
Shasta daisies, pansies, and the like will prove
a veritable little pin-money mine and equally
profitable will be found peppers, cauliflowers,
bush musk-melons and other of the choicer vegetables,
all requiring, practically, the same treatment.</p>

<p>The shut-in who wishes to specialize in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
unusual might make an attempt to imitate the
dwarf trees of China and Japan. This is not so
impossible or difficult as it appears as the appearance
of great age is more often the result of skill
than of many years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="small">THE POSSIBILITIES OF A CITY FLAT</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> possibilities of the city flat will depend
upon just how much window space the flat
affords and how much sunlight the windows receive,
for upon the amount of light will depend
not so much the quantities of flowers which may
be grown, as their character.</p>

<p>It may be possible that, in a restricted area, but
one window can be devoted to the growing of
plants during the winter season and where that
is the case one will wish to realize as much pleasure
as possible from that one window. If it is
a sunny window then it will be an easy matter
to fill it full of bright flowers. Now no flower
so well withstands the heat and dust of our living-rooms
as the geraniums, but it is by no means
necessary that they should be of the more common
zonal type. The Lady Washington geraniums&mdash;pelargoniums&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
far more beautiful
and even more prolific in their bloom. They
may be purchased all ready to bloom of the florist
or easily raised, from spring sown seed, to
blooming size by fall. Heliotropes, the sweetest
of all flowers, will bloom freely in any sunny
window if the precaution is taken to spray or wet
the foliage thoroughly every day; without this
refreshing bath the foliage will curl up and die
and the buds blast.</p>

<p>The carnation is an excellent plant for the
sunny window but must be sprayed frequently
to keep in check the red spider, and all the spring
blooming bulbs can be depended upon for the
winter window garden and have this advantage
that they can be potted in the fall, tucked away
in a dark closet somewhere and brought out when
ready to begin blooming, and again relegated to
any out of the way place as soon as their season
of bloom is passed.</p>

<p>The most convenient way of growing house
plants where there are only common windows to
accommodate them is in boxes made to fit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
window-sills. The ready-to-use metal boxes are
very handy and satisfactory, but not as attractive
as simple boxes made of wood to match the standing
woodwork of the room; these should have a
metal lining to protect the woodwork and if the
expense of boxes of hardwood in a rented flat
seems undesirable, very simple boxes of cheap
wood may be made to imitate the hardwood finish
by giving a covering of the paper or wood pulp
that comes in all the natural hardwood finishes.
This is simply pasted on the boxes and when dry
should be given a coat of sizing-glue dissolved in
hot water to a thin paste, and when this is dry
a coat of varnish or jap-a-lac. This will be
so successful that few casual observers will detect
the substitution. A very pretty plant box
can be evolved from a single cheese box, cut
down a couple of inches covered with the paper
and supplied with legs or mounted on a small
lamp stand, or white enamel will be charming, especially
when the box is filled with blooming
tulips or narcissi, or given over to ferns, asparagus
vines and the like.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>Where one has a window opening on to an air
shaft or a court that gives no view but infringes
one's privacy a delightful screen which will not
deprive one of too much light and air, but effectually
screen the window is made from a box the
length of the window-sill, fitted with double
casters to allow it to be moved from place to
place. A long rod or wire, long enough to extend
upright as high as the screen is desired, cross
over and return on the other side, should be fitted
into the end boards close to the back by boring
holes with a drill the size of the rod for nearly
the depth of the wood and the ends of the wires
firmly sunk in them. The frame is then covered
with wire netting or twine and the box planted
to some light, graceful vine like the asparagus
plumosus nanna, the manettia vine, clarodendron,
but the plumosus nanna is an excellent
choice. Such a screen is very convenient and
artistic between two rooms where it is desired
to leave a door open for air, but desirable to
screen the contents of one of them.</p>

<p>It is the summer flat, however, that offers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
greater possibilities of floriculture for in this season
the boxes may be placed outside of the windows
if properly secured, and a much greater
variety of plants grown, for there is no exposure
for which there are not many delightful things
available. A north window, that to many would
seem especially undesirable for plants, will often
be found to develop the most interesting boxes.
All the hardier varieties of cultivated ferns may
be usual here, all the blooming and fibrous rooted
begonias, all the asparagus fern, especially A.
sprengeri, the various impatiens, especially I.
sultani, the trailing fuchsias, abutilons, variegated
wandering Jew, aspidistras, farfugiums.
Palm grass, Pannicum Excurrens&mdash;a palm-like
grass which one has to send to southern florists
for but which grows rankly at the north, either
in the house or in the open ground&mdash;is good.
I bedded one out in spring, intending to lift
in the fall for interior decoration and found it to
have made so sturdy a root growth, and so immense
a top that it defied a spade to move it
and had to be abandoned to the frost. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
doors its long, curved leaves are most attractive
and interesting. It is a magnificent plant for
the rear wall of a sun room or conservatory.</p>

<p>If one occupies a flat with a rear outside staircase,
then one may utilize the top of the railing
to place boxes of trailing nasturtiums and bright
flowers&mdash;a planting of nasturtiums in the rear,
a middle planting of geraniums, justitias, petunias,
verbenas, phlox drummondii, etc., and a
fringe of sweet alyssum or other delicate trailer
along the front will give a succession of bloom
all the summer long.</p>

<p>Along the outer edge of the steps one may arrange
small but deep boxes of earth and in each
plant blooming vines such as the Japanese morning
glory, the cob&aelig;a scandens, flowering beans,
or that gay little new vine&mdash;the cardinal
climber. These may be trained to run on wire
or cord so as to afford privacy for the stairway,
or if this is not desired, trailing vines and erect
plants may be used instead, the trailers masking
the unlovely architecture of the stairs.</p>

<p>Possibly one may be in possession of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
those flats whose side windows look out upon the
roof of a lower building&mdash;a tin roof expansion of
ugliness which is a hindrance to spiritual calm
and mental cheerfulness. If this is the case,
why not utilize it to create a roof garden? If
the area is small one can utilize all of it, if too
large then pre-empt the portion nearest one
and draw a trellis of wire across the boundary
line on which one may grow in long, narrow
boxes of soil morning glories galore. It is not
necessary that these boxes be of anything but
the roughest construction; home-made boxes,
evolved from old packing cases, are as good as
anything as they will be masked by the plants and
vines; these should extend around three or even
all four sides of the roof, those in the rear and,
if it is desired to secure privacy, those on the sides,
being planted with vines or tall-growing plants
like ricinus, cannas, cleomes, cosmos and the like.
It will not be desirable to leave too much open
space in a garden of this sort, unless it will be possible
to cover the roof with sand or sawdust that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
can be wet down with the hose to create a moist
atmosphere; but where this can be done a very successful
roof garden can be created with the principal
expenditure that for earth and sawdust.
Most flowers of the summer garden can be grown
in such a position and one could arrange a very
satisfactory little lily pool and fountain by means
of a big zinc tub, a length of hose, two or three
water lilies and some gold fish. A few inches of
earth in the tub will supply a footing for the
lilies and a mask of plants around the base will
hide the crudeness of the pool.</p>

<p>When one has undertaken a garden like this
it will be found surprising how many things one
will pick up in one's little excursions out of town
to add to it; all one's friends will take an interest
and pleasure in donating seeds and plants and if
the roof affords room for a hammock and a few
chairs, the question of where to go for a summer
vacation will not take on such poignant interest,
nor the inability to afford one be so great a tragedy.
Such an oasis in the heart of a city will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
a delight to a child and solve the problem of keeping
it off the street and from undesirable companions.
I should like to think that a good many
such little oases will develop and that I might
know of them.</p>

<p>It might be that two or more people have
homes overlooking a roof who would join together
in the making of a garden. In that way
a larger area could be undertaken and the expense
would not be seriously felt. If the roof
is one exposed to much sunshine, then one should
select plants which revel in sunshine like the annual
poppy, the verbena, salvia, sweet alyssum,
candytuft, ageratum, dahlia, canna, California
poppy, asters; all these are hardy, easily grown
plants, which will give an abundance of bloom all
summer. Of course geraniums' and coleus can
also be depended upon to do their prettiest, but
one and all should have a daily or semi-daily showering
with a hose to remove the grime and dust
of the day and freshen the foliage as well as to
provide the necessary water to drink. Probably
the entire success of the roof garden will depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327&ndash;328</a></span>
upon just this one feature of an adequate water
supply at the roots and a thorough cleansing of
the foliage each day. Given this there is no reason
why a garden of this sort should not be a
success.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
